At [MapBox](http://mapbox.com), part of [Development Seed](http://developmentseed.org), I've been working on [TileMill](http://tilemill.com), TileStream, [Wax](http://developmentseed.org/blog/2011/jun/10/wax-custom-advanced-ui-web-maps), and lots of other fun mapping-related projects. It's a cool job, and thus I'm not looking for work.

* I made a [running map](http://macwright.org/2011/07/28/mapping-runs.html) that
  got [on Runners World](http://othervoices.runnersworld.com/2011/08/the-art-of-the-run/)
  and [Fuck Yes Maps](http://fuckyesmaps.tumblr.com/day/2011/08/02), both of
  I was psyched about, being a reader of both.
* Way back in the day, I made the [Swem Signal](https://swem.wm.edu/um/swemsignal/),
  which lives on with the help of [Swem Library](https://swem.wm.edu/)'s awesome,
  inspiring staff. Librarians are cool people. It was a nice adventure - which spawned
  library locators at [UMass Dartmouth](http://www.lib.umassd.edu/libraryinfo/findmehere.html)
  and a [Facebook port](http://code.google.com/p/facebook-athenaeum/).
* I was, for a while, a maintainer of [a lot of Drupal-based code](http://drupal.org/user/12664),
  and before that, a whole lot of [Textpattern](http://textpattern.com) code. Of the two,
  TextPattern's a more endearing kludge.
