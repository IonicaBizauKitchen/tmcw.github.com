At [MapBox](http://mapbox.com), part of [Development Seed](http://developmentseed.org), I've been working on [TileMill](http://tilemill.com), TileStream, [Wax](http://developmentseed.org/blog/2011/jun/10/wax-custom-advanced-ui-web-maps), and lots of other fun mapping-related projects. It's a cool job, and thus I'm not looking for work.
