I'm Tom MacWright, a developer at [MapBox](http://mapbox.com/).
<a href='mailto:tom@macwright.org'>email me</a>
to get in contact, but [file tickets at support](http://support.mapbox.com/dashboard)
or [issues on github](https://github.com/tmcw) for anything specific about a project
I'm involved in. I'm [@tmcw](http://twitter.com/tmcw) on Twitter,
and don't actively use any other social networks.

## Presentations

I've spoken at quite a few different events. [Here are the slides from most of them](http://macwright.org/presentations/).

## Colophon

If you're curious, this site uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and is hosted by [GitHub](http://github.com).
Images are hosted on [Flickr](http://flickr.com) and maps on [MapBox Hosting](http://tiles.mapbox.com/).
I use vim and [have my .vim on GitHub](https://github.com/tmcw/.vim).
