_Last time we [talked about how the law is compiled in Washington, DC](http://macwright.org/2013/02/13/the-code-compiled.html),
by a combination of district employees drafting bills which are 'changesets'
to the law, which are applied to the law by contractors. The end result is
that the district itself does not hold a complete, copyright-free digital
copy of the law - it is only held by the company they pay. Let's discuss
why this is a problem: is the law free in the first place, and what does
free mean?_

Federal and state laws are public domain: they cannot be copyrighted.

[Copyright](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright) is a legal concept of exclusive rights:
a copyright owner can decide to sell copies or licenses of 'the work',
like music, text, or art. They can also let others use the work and declare how they
want to be credited.

They can also [use a copyleft license](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft) to
free the work to some degree - they still own the copyright but allow others
to copy it as if it isn't copywritten. Familiar forms of copyleft are
[Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/) licenses and open source
licenses like the GPL and BSD licenses.

[Public domain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain) is **lack of copyright**:
there are no intellectual property rights for public domain works. That means
you can sell copies of the Mona Lisa or Hamlet or operate a site like
[Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/) that gives away free public domain books.
Public domain is a stronger form of freedom than copyleft. The copyright
holder does not cede or license specific rights by their own volition: there
is no copyright holder.

> This applies to such works whether they are Federal, State, or local as

State laws [cannot be copyrighted](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_law_of_the_United_States#Federal_and_state_laws_are_not_copyrighted),
because the US Government intelligently realizes that it's important
that citizens can access them freely, and copyright usually restricts distribution.

For instance, I can technically sell you a copy of Florida's laws and make a
profit off of it. And you can make a copy of that copy, and, in turn,
make a profit off of that. And your friend can buy a copy, use it as a texture
in their art piece, without asking anyone's permission or giving anyone credit.

DC is an interesting case. Since it isn't a state, it isn't subject to the
general law that state works are public domain. [(ref)](http://ipmall.info/hosted_resources/CopyrightCompendium/chapter_0200.asp)
