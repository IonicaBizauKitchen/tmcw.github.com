[Development Seed](http://developmentseed.org) hosted a [foosball
tournament for DCWeek](http://developmentseed.org/blog/2011/nov/08/recapping-dc-tech-foosball-shootout/),
and my team 'Foolsball' - came in approximately
third to fourth. Congratulations to the winners, "Backalley FC".

My band [Teen Mom](http://teenmomdc.bandcamp.com/) got a spot playing
the opening party for [DCWeek](http://digitalcapitalweek.org/),
and thus got to grab (one half) of the
huge stage at the [9:30 Club](http://930.com/) (for 15 minutes).

This merited our first, albeit unnamed photos in [Brightest Young Things](http://www.brightestyoungthings.com/articles/photos-dcweek-kick-off-party-930-club.htm).
I did an extremely rough compression of our first single
(which is being perfected at [The Bastille](http://thebastillestudio.com/)) -
so there's some online evidence of our existence in audio form.

I swung a quick trip up to Troy, NY for [Elusive Persona](http://www.photocentertroy.org/exhibits-calls/exhibits.html),
an opening by [my sister](http://sarahmacwright.com/) and [Carrie Will](http://www.carriewill.com/).

## Consumption

There's been quite a bit flowing in and out of my [Instapaper](http://instapaper.com/)
and Kindle.

* [Cory Doctorow's Scroogled](http://www.scroogle.org/doctorow.html) is a
  rather dramatic but pretty effective piece. I think I might read a bit more,
  since he has a unique ability to write about technology without
  butchering the details.
* [Andy Woodruff's Value by Alpha](http://andywoodruff.com/blog/value-by-alpha-maps/)
  is awesome. Now that maps and visualizations are hip, there are a lot
  of opinions floating around, and kind of odd tangents like dymaxion maps
  and cartograms gain traction. But, for people who really actually make
  things daily, like Andy - there's real value to having things be understandable,
  rather than just flashy.
* [This inverview series with Lynn Margulis](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8xqu_TlQPU)
  is touching, inspiring, and really gripping for a million reasons. I
  adore [this one bit in the second episode where she rephrases a question](http://youtu.be/KOjKZdW8HSY?t=1m20s).
  She certainly wasn't a spotless character - Google will pull up enough evidence
  for judgmental types to dismiss her - but the way that she handled science,
  with the attitude that sharing is the end result of research, and understanding
  isn't just about publishing dry scientific articles, is a model for all
  disciplines. Sadly she died on the 22nd.
* [Greenland](http://greenland.bandcamp.com/) is the latest happy
  realization that DC produces some good music. They've got a lot of albums
  online for free: get them.
