<p class='addendum'>
On Friday, I'm doing a quick presentation about the process of building
<a href='http://ideditor.com'>iD</a> in <a href='http://d3js.org/'>d3</a>.
This is a preformation of thought aimed at reducing onstage wandering
and equalizing what I say for those who won't be there for any reason.

And so, d3 for HTML.

[d3](http://d3js.org/) is a JavaScript library that has the stated aim of
'manipulating documents based on data'. In its rise to prominence, d3
became known [mainly in combination with SVG](http://macwright.org/2013/06/25/just-enough-svg.html) -
the recipe that [yields pretty streamgraphs](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4060954)
and [maps](http://trends.truliablog.com/2012/02/where-are-house-hunters-searching/),
and the one for which much of the library is built. The [gallery](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery)
is beautiful - the internet's top design/coders use d3 to build incredible
things.

</a>

And then I built [dccode.org/browser](http://dccode.org/browser/) in all 'pure' d3.<sup>[1](#but)</sup>
It doesn't touch d3's incredible ability to build interactive maps or beautiful
graphs like [you'll see in infinite scroll of Mike's bl.ocks.org](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock) page.
In fact it's pretty boring from a technical perspective, as a flat website
that's just HTML, with permalinks and the classic multiple-column navigation
pattern.

Here's a bit on why we shoehorned a 'visualization framework' into the boring
old law. For reference, [the GitHub repository so you can see the code](https://github.com/openlawdc/browser).

## Data

{% highlight js %}
d3.json('index.json').on('load', function(index) {
    titles_div.datum(index.titles)
    // and so on.
});
{% endhighlight %}

d3's idea of _data_ is extremely flexible. There's no idea of a ['Model'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller)
in the conventional sense - instead the data bound to the document is simply
anything that's a list of objects. This comes in handy in cases where
data is simple and flat, like the browser.

It also helps in way more complicated cases like in the [iD editor](http://ideditor.com/), in which the model
is not only [a persistent object graph](http://www.mapbox.com/osmdev/2013/02/26/id-architecture-part-1/)
like [Git](http://git-scm.com/), but the application also needs to compensate
for missing data and heavily validate each state.

## Templates / No Templates / The View

![](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7404/9195174570_24b9711e67_z.jpg)

One recent project was building an intranet for [MapBox](http://www.mapbox.com/) -
a bare minimum 'who we are and what we are saying' type system. So, it's essentially
a handful of small projects that pull from collectively-edited JSON documents
and the GitHub API.

Posting about this and giving a quick in-house talk on building those kinds of
things with d3 brought up a point I had forgotten about:
_when you build with d3, you almost never use templating_.

This is an interesting bit, because there's a very valid case against it.

### Templates

Templates are an odd thing. In the JavaScript land, templates are basically
a hack, though a very popular one. If you look at a popular templating system
like [underscore's](http://documentcloud.github.io/underscore/), [the templating code](http://documentcloud.github.io/underscore/docs/underscore.html#section-139)
is a collection of things that would make [JSHint](http://www.jshint.com/) faint.

Not that there's anything wrong with that - it's an effective and contained
sort of hack. But the integration of templates into [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/)
or any other system shouldn't distract one from the fact that you're turning
strings into code, running that against more code and some data, producing more
strings, and then cramming this into a page with [innerHTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/element.innerHTML)
and hoping it all turns out okay.

## Views

So maybe it's easier to talk about why it's better to write confusing-looking
JavaScript rather than friendly-looking HTML templates when one considers
the page as a view rather than a semi-static representation.<sup><a href='#degrading'>2</a></sup>

So, in a first iteration of a site, you might build a template that looks like

{% highlight erb %}
<% _.each(animals, function(a) { %>
    <span class='animal'><%= a.name %></span>
<% }); %>
{% endhighlight %}

And then in your Bootstrap view, you'll have a chunk that catches click
events on that `span` and routes those clicks to a certain method.

{% highlight js %}
events: {
  "click .animal": "animalClick"
}
{% endhighlight %}

That `animalClick` function then gets the event, and does something like

{% highlight js %}
var thisAnimal = $(e.target, this.el).text();
{% endhighlight %}

To figure out which one was clicked. Until you have multiple animals with the
same name, in which case you edit the template to include something like
`data-id='animalid'` - that is, if animals have unique IDs that can be represented
as strings in HTML. Then, your click handler pulls from that attribute, and
searches through its model to figure out which one was clicked.

In reality, we end up doing a lot of data storage and reference in the DOM, but storage in
attributes - in `data` attributes, in the contents of `href`, and so on.

Finally, when you modify the DOM, you're modifying what you created with a template -
so you need to make assumptions based on what's in the template, especially
in terms of 'semantic classes' like `active`, which are often used
for more than just styling.

## With d3

Bsuilding views in d3 has a sort of simplicity that comes after accepting
the aha-jump of [understanding selections](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/selection/)
and so on. That is, instead of being in a different mode when you're templating a page,
receiving events, and modifying the DOM, it's all in the same place, without
any scary abstractions.

Create a list of 3 elements, for example:

{% highlight js %}
d3.select('body')
  .selectAll('div')
  .data([1,2,3])
  .enter()
  .append('div')
  .text(String);
{% endhighlight %}

When you want to bind an event on a click, at the end of the chain it's
just

{% highlight js %}
  .on('click', function(d) {
     alert(d);
  });
{% endhighlight %}

And the `d` argument is always the _bound data_ - there's no hunt
through a datastore with an id pulled from a data attribute as a guide.
The clicked element is accessible with a simple `this`, and changes to it
are performed in the same way on updates as they are in its creation.

## Selections

To look back to the [DC Code](http://dccode.org/browser/#/1/1-103) example -
[selections](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/selection/) are the bread and butter
of structure in d3. Across the screen, you'll see three selections: navigation,
subnavigation, and content. Each is managed with a simple selection and assigned
different data as the page changes, similar to how a view works.

For instance, when a section of the law is loaded,

{% highlight js %}
var content = section_div.selectAll('div.content')
    .data([section], function(d) { return d.heading.identifier; });

content.exit().remove();

var div = content.enter()
    .append('div')
    .attr('class', 'content')
    .property('scrollTop', 0);

div.append('h1')
    .attr('class', 'pad2')
    .text(function(d) { return d.heading.catch_text; });
{% endhighlight %}

From here, it's easy to add little details, like lists of history, subsections,
links, and so on.

### Issues

There are, of course, issues with this approach.

While you can create wild abstractions within underscore templates, it's easier
for d3-based code to get out of hand. Between [d3's behaviors](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Behaviors),
use of higher-order functions, and fancy ways to update the DOM, you can
build things that are inaccessible to people who are better at design than you.

You also buy in to d3's rejection of IE9 and prior - something that you
can mostly patch together by using [aight](https://github.com/shawnbot/aight) but
isn't going to be a fun experience.

Finally, it's less clear to see how one could move computation to the server
with this approach - you can run d3 with [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and
build a DOM with [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom), but it's not going
to be performant, and there's the open question of how data bindings could
ever make sense in that realm.

And So On.

For the things I've needed to make recently, d3 works rather well for going
from data to a page, to an interactive or self-updating page. Try it out,
see if it works for you.
