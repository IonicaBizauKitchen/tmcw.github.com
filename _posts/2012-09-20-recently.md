## Reading

* Finally finished [A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6748.A_Supposedly_Fun_Thing_I_ll_Never_Do_Again)
  and absolutely loved it. I'm less and less that guy who says he loves
  David Foster Wallace but has only read snippets. Though I really want to
  find out what the [full color spiderman hat](http://books.google.com/books?id=qN9Z9UQWwsgC&lpg=PP216&ots=AgvTwAlc5a&dq=david%20foster%20wallace%20full-color%20spiderman%20hat&pg=PP216#v=onepage&q=david%20foster%20wallace%20full-color%20spiderman%20hat&f=false)
  he repeatedly refers to is.
* I've been slowly reading this [HÃ¥kon Wium Lie's awesome thesis about style sheets](http://people.opera.com/howcome/2006/phd/),
  which is really interesting in terms of history; previous innovation
  just being buried and forgotten, and the reasons for decisions
  obscured.
* [Feist vs. Rural](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feist_v._Rural) is a cool
  read (for a Wikipedia article about a lawsuit about copyright law), and relates
  to [the Aaron Schwartz](http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/09/aaron-swartz-felony/)
  suit as well as [public.resource.org](https://public.resource.org/), one of
  my favorite non-profits (albeit with a terrible site design).
* Mary Rose Cooke's [Isla](https://github.com/maryrosecook/isla) is a really
  cool example of a langauge parser and interpreter written in Clojure. Lisp
  is the one language that still totally puzzles me, so I've been taking
  time to read and ogle at the mysteries. That, and the [whole concept](http://islalanguage.org/)
  of the language is really cool.

This month [Teen Mom](http://teenmomdc.bandcamp.com/) also played our first New York
show, got real-life vinyl albums to sell (at shows, now, online, soon), and
recorded most of a new set of four singles.

## Watching

[The White Ribbon](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1149362/), [Rabbits](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0347840/),
[Wild at Heart](http://goo.gl/13L9p) (viewed in small snippets at a recording
studio / not trying to sound cool but really), now that I've read more DFW
probably all other Lynch films will be watched soon.

## On Deck

It's going to be an exciting few months.

I'm speaking at [Visualized](http://visualized.com/) and am deathly afraid,
[State of the Map US](http://stateofthemap.us/) and am less afraid.

[MapBox](http://mapbox.com/) finally won and can announce a [$575k grant](http://mapbox.com/blog/knight-invests-openstreetmap/)
for [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) improvements.
And I'm going to [Montreal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal) next week.
