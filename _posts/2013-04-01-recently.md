This month I made [ration](https://github.com/tmcw/ration), which rations
items in intervals. [GPSTile](https://github.com/tmcw/gpstile) does
[pretty OSM GPS tiles](http://macwright.org/gpstile/#14/38.9000/-76.9900).
[osm-auth](https://github.com/osmlab/osm-auth) auths osm, [osm-live-map](https://github.com/osmlab/osm-live-map)
is a [live map of osm](http://osmlab.github.com/osm-live-map/). [osm-stream](https://github.com/osmlab/osm-stream)
provides it with streaming data. [an ironic entry](http://macwright.org/100-lines-or-less-js/leafmap/) to
the [100 lines or less contest](https://github.com/tmcw/100-lines-or-less-js/blob/gh-pages/leafmap/js/basemaptour.js#L1-L13)
to use [Esri](http://www.esri.com/)'s 'trade secret' Javascript API. A
[nice browser for OSM tracing imagery](http://osmlab.github.com/editor-imagery-index/).
[basicrequest](https://github.com/tmcw/basicrequest) does super-simple ajax.
[leaflet-pip](https://github.com/tmcw/leaflet-pip) does points in polygons
in [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/). I've been using
[browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) a lot, and it's
making tiny modular Javascript components like those in [osmlab](https://github.com/osmlab)
possible.

## The Code

<img src='http://macwright.org/graphics/dc.gif' width='100%' />

This was a big, big month for the DC Code, thanks to [Carl Malamud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Malamud),
who did the heavy lifting, scanning, [OCR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition)ing,
ordering, and so on to get
the code from paper to PDF and even a bit to text. There's so much more to
do, but having real and available files for these pages that have occupying
so much of my mind for months feels like the start of something.

a [unboxing on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/62936439), and, of course,
[the PDF-format code as a bulk download on Public.Resource.org](https://law.resource.org/pub/us/code/dc/).

## Thinking

> when you don't create things, you become defined by your tastes rather than ability. your tastes only narrow & exclude people. so create. - _why

this is the quote of the last two years.

**One of the most satisfying experiences in this industry of making
[short lived things](http://macwright.org/2012/06/13/programming.html) is
when you make an idea that lives beyond the first implementation.**
Like books written in dead languages and read in living ones, or a
million similar versions of the same clever design for bike lights.
There are a few instances of this I really like - how certain 'recent inventions'
like [Atkinson dithering](http://mike.teczno.com/notes/atkinson.html) or
[Perlin noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise) can seem like
fundamental algorithms despite being quite young.

**Clean APIs aren't easy, easy APIs aren't clean.** The clearest example
I can see here is syntax sugar: methods only a line or two long that give
a concept a name. A [markers API](https://github.com/mapbox/markers.js)
that provides a single `.features()` call
has the same power as one with `clearMarkers()`, `addMarker()`, `removeMarker()`,
and so on - but connecting the one-line-of-course-code dot not only
enables na√Øve developers who don't know Javascript (there are many), but it
also plays into a desire to have a single method-per-thought-concept.
Those in the know understand that there are a handful of core concepts
and you can have a complete system with a tiny API - but the concepts that
APIs need to worry about are the ones users think are atomic, not those that
are atomic.

**What is easy is what is familiar.** Familiarity is the most underrated
usability factor. And what's familiar is what is learned early.

**Always demonstrate the potential of abstracted ideas.** While it's very
useful in programming terms to write code that does on this perfectly and
is completely tested and extremely useful for some certain case, a lot of
people _don't know what that case is_. Show them - demonstrate the
'art of the possible' by creating an example for absolutely every thing
you make. Sometimes I think we've done this right - the [mapbox.js examples](http://mapbox.com/mapbox.js/examples/)
just grow and grow, and [Mike Bostock's little experiments](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock)
are the raw ingredients of most [d3js](http://d3js.org/) hacks.

**The thing about big libraries and frameworks** is that the availability
of an 'app for that' or a 'method for that' soon becomes a dictate
that 'if there's a method for that
in that library, you must use it'. Case in point should be [jQuery](http://jquery.com/),
which introduced an honestly web-changing selector engine and [monadic](http://bit.ly/Ye2Stv)
API, coupled with a lackluster and not-recommend [`$.each` method](http://api.jquery.com/each/).
But a lot of jQuery programmers used it for selectors and felt guilty using
`for()` loops when there was a 'library way' of doing them, so went the `$.each` route.
_Use the library when it's better, not just because it's available._
