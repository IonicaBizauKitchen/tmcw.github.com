> The name was also a reaction against the "IndoEuropean god theory" where systems were named Zeus, Odin, and Thor, and hardly did anything. I figured that "Smalltalk" was so innocuous a label that if it ever did anything nice people would be pleasantly surprised.

> The greatest progress is in the sciences that study the simplest systems. So take, say physics â€” greatest progress there. But one of the reasons is that the physicists have an advantage that no other branch of sciences has. If something gets too complicated, they hand it to someone else.

As it turns out, this is the first month I've gotten, as part of Teen Mom,
numeric ratings. One [6/10](http://inyourspeakers.com/content/news/204-teen-moms-say-my-name-tale-two-recordings-11192012),
one [8.5/10](http://thefourohfive.com/review/article/teen-mom-teen-mom-ep), thus a **7.25/10** average. I think
that warrants a Pavement quote.
