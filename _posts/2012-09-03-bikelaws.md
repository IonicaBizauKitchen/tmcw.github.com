Bike laws is a mini-website for smartphones with the most important laws
for bicycles in Washington, DC, citations of those laws, and what to do
to obey them and report those who don't.

[Few people know DC's bike laws](http://www.tbd.com/blogs/tbd-on-foot/2012/05/the-ongoing-confusion-over-d-c-bike-laws-15372.html),
and it's not a safe city. DC drivers are [amongst the worst in the country](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/dr-gridlock/post/dc-drivers-are-the-worst-in-the-country-report-says/2012/08/28/2792ae5e-f137-11e1-adc6-87dfa8eff430_blog.html),
and its percentage of traffic fatalities that are pedestrians is
[four times the national average](http://www.wtop.com/41/2981518/DC-4-times-national-average-in-pedestrian-traffic-accident-fatalities).
