Washington, DC is not a simple city to bike in. Despite its bike-rental
program, bike lanes,
and bike-friendly legislation, pedestrian fatalities are too common
and the essential laws are unknown.

[bikelawDC](http://macwright.org/stories/bikelawdc/) collects the most important laws about helmets, riding on sidewalks,
dooring, yielding and more, cites them by number and with a link to the
DC Municipal Regulations, and points to next actions: whether dialing 911, notifying
@DCDPW, or buying a helmet at a local bike shop.

I want this app to make both cyclists, drivers, and police officers more aware
of the law, and better able to use it. I hope it's handed to police who
wrongly give tickets for obstructing traffic or failing to yield when the
law says different. Cyclists should have reflectors for riding at night,
and never ride drunk - it's a DUI. Drivers should yield to cyclists in bike
lanes, and always check before opening doors.

_In short, this is not made to make you angry._ The world has enough flamewars
and middle fingers, and not nearly enough enforcement, understandings, or
citations. There are next actions for each rule - whether it's calling 911,
reporting it to the [DCDPW](http://twitter.com/DCDPW), or buying a helmet.

It's free and [open source](https://github.com/tmcw/stories/) -
please fork & create one for your city.
