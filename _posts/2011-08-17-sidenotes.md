## Music

I'm working on a few music projects. [Lights](http://pueblo.bandcamp.com/album/lights-traditional-songs)
is a continuing album of traditional banjo and fiddle tunes played in
[clawhammer style](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clawhammer) solo. So far it's split
between songs on a bowl-back fretless banjo and my fretted,
scooped [Enoch](http://www.enochbanjos.com/ready.html). I'll be slowly
updating it, so if you'd like to stay tuned, you can subscribe to
an [RSS feed of added songs.](http://pueblo.bandcamp.com/feed/album/lights-traditional-songs)
This week the awesome [MetaFilter podcast featured Old Joe Clark](http://metatalk.metafilter.com/20896/64-Unsticking-a-dead-mouse).

My other band, [Teen Mom](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Teen-Mom-DC/191023127616953), recorded
at [The Bastille](http://thebastillestudio.com/) this month and is expecting a combination of
EPs and a single within a month or two. We got [our first review](http://dcrocklive.blogspot.com/2011/08/mercies-teen-mom-black-cat-aug-7-2011.html)
on a friendly music blog, and one of these nights will have a real website
free from the shackles of Facebook.

## Follow-ups

Thanks to the awesome [David Klatt](http://davidnklatt.wordpress.com/)
who contacted me and wrote up
[my running map](http://macwright.org/2011/07/28/mapping-runs.html)
in [Runner's World](http://othervoices.runnersworld.com/2011/08/the-art-of-the-run/)!
The reaction was awesome and hopefully means that more people will be
insisting on freeing their data and making cool stuff from it. In
hindsight, even the half-finished, undocument API that Garmin
publishes is pretty nice - there's a lot more work to do elsewhere.

To clarify the previous article, as pointed out by the ever-awesome
[Michal Migurski](http://mike.teczno.com/) - what I'm doing is doing polygon
queries by approximately translating the problem into raster queries, which
can be super-fast and require very little algorithmic code, but require
a precomputed source (which I generate with [TileMill](http://tilemill.com)),
and have limited accuracy, which you can check out in the interactive
graph. It's a tradeoff, but I think it tends to be a very useful one.

## Bonus

[â†“ Massive Saxophone Acquiantance'd Edition.mp3](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9732714/%233%20Acquaintance%27d%20Edition.mp3)

This week I dropped in to be a semi-informed non-self-proclaimed 'web guru'
talking about Google Plus on
[The Massive Saxophone podcast](http://massivesaxophone.tumblr.com/). My
radio voice is clearly lacking, but the rest of the podcasts are gold - I
highly recommend [the iTunes feed](pcast://feeds.feedburner.com/MassiveSaxophone).
To be clear, I have [spoken](http://acquia.com/resources/podcasts/acquia-podcast-22-devseed-mapping-drupal) on topics that I [know a bit more](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfREVxIswCU) about.
