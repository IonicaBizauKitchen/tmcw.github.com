## Tunes

Via [Dolfish](http://www.myspace.com/ourcatphilip), the awesome band/man who
opened for [Pueblo](http://pueblo.bandcamp.com) at our last show, I found
[Way Yes](http://wayyes.com/album/walkability), which is somehow a band/man
from Ohio, but it's classy, catchy island pop, just happy enough to float
your day along but not over the [twee line](http://www.myspace.com/aberfeldytheband).

Similarly, [Hella](http://hella.bandcamp.com/) released a new album and it's
pure goodness; catchy, mathy, occasionally shreddy instrumental rock.
And in a more well-known vein, the [Handsome Furs](http://www.subpop.com/artists/handsome_furs.html)
released a new album that pushes their special brand of raw
electro-Springsteen-strung-out-anthems.

## Reading

Teaching is the new jam. It makes sense that [John Resig](http://ejohn.org/),
[jQuery](http://jquery.org) creator and former
[Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org/) dude, left his job to
work at [the Kahn Academy](http://ejohn.org/blog/next-steps-in-2011/). Or why
[_why fancied himself a freelance professor](http://ds.io/rgs2cf).

This is why I'm trying to [write unusually good documentation](http://ds.io/nYt6HB)
and am working on much more to explain. Stuff that we usually explain with
dry math, [ideally we can describe with play and interaction, like I'm trying to do with Visible Map](http://mapbox.github.com/demo/visiblemap/)

People who use technology need theory,
and they need math; and once they've learned linear algebra and the like, I'm
finding that blogs are far more effective educators than lectures, in my
personal experience and in this area - in which the art of teaching and testing
is still new.

* [Linear Algebra for Game Developers](http://ds.io/nkzo8Y) (and parts
  [2](http://ds.io/o1QfuY) and [3](http://ds.io/pE0OdF)) is just incredibly good.
  And it's really useful for understanding
  [CSS transformation matrices](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-2d-transforms/#transform-functions),
  which are only [somewhat technically described by the w3 itself](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/coords.html#TransformMatrixDefined).
* [Understanding JIT spray](http://ds.io/nFouiS): crazy hacks require
  crazy explanations.
* I finally got around to reading
  [The Continuous World of Dungeon Siege](http://ds.io/rm9XKk) [pdf], which came
  recommended by [Mike Migurski](http://mike.teczno.com/) and
  [Tom Carden](http://www.tom-carden.co.uk/), with whom I work on
  [Modest Maps](https://github.com/stamen/modestmaps-js).
* [Everything Eli Bendersky writes](http://ds.io/pKizr5) is over my head, but
  in a good way.
* [This article on raytracing](http://c0de517e.blogspot.com/2011/09/raytracing-myths.html)
  is really nice in laying out angles of algorithms that usually aren't discussed -
  people either mention ease of implementation, theoretical efficiency,
  precision vs. heuristics - rarely all at once.
