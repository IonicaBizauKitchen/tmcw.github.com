**Preface**: this time `Recently` isn't just a collection - it
includes 'thinking' sections. This presumes you're interested in my thoughts
and that I'm qualified to write about the topics: feel free to skip these sections.

## Reading

* [Grokking V8 Closures for Fun and Profit](http://mrale.ph/blog/2012/09/23/grokking-v8-closures-for-fun.html) by
  Vyacheslav Egorov is great deep Javascript knowledge. I'll post an update to my
  article on [the module pattern](http://macwright.org/2012/06/04/the-module-pattern.html) with
  knowledge I gained in the second half of the year.
* [You are Not Your Code](http://sstephenson.us/posts/you-are-not-your-code) is
  precisely correct and tough to swallow.
* [The Web We Lost](http://dashes.com/anil/2012/12/the-web-we-lost.html) will
  be a classic of 2012, and [Rebuilding the Web We Lost](http://dashes.com/anil/2012/12/rebuilding-the-web-we-lost.html) is
  great.
* I've been reading quite a bit about this point between 'analog' and 'digital'
  and 'online' and 'offline'. [Mr. Penumbra's 24 Hour Bookstore](http://www.robinsloan.com/penumbra/short-story/),
  [Hi Haters!](http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/hi-haters/), [Impersonating the Machine](http://booktwo.org/notebook/impersonating-the-machine/),
  [Digital-Physical](http://craigmod.com/journal/digital_physical/), and so on.

## Listening

* [Lee Hazlewood](http://www.leehazlewoodmusic.com/)'s _Requiem for An Almost Lady_
  is pretty unique in its style and message.
* [Dirty Projectors](http://dirtyprojectors.net/)'s _Swing Low Magellan_ is
  a surprising pop hit.
* [Beach House](http://www.beachhousebaltimore.com/)'s _Bloom_ is classic Beach
  House (repeated climax) but perfect for that start-of-the-year energy.
* [Wilco](http://wilcoworld.net/)'s _A.M._ is 18 years old but has a few hits
  I had never appreciated, like "That's Not The Issue", which feels closer
  to Cake than to Wilco's soloing-dad-rock with tinges of Radiohead of today.
* TNGHT's _Higher Ground_, which [Andy](http://massivesaxophone.tumblr.com/)
  introduced me to over New Years, is a hit.

## Thinking about Ownership

At MapBox there's a recurring question of how open source software works
once you have written more than you can maintain on a personal level. I think
I have gotten there, with some degree of responsibility over more than
10 active projects.

There are examples of 'benevolent dictators' who stay on in a strong role, like
[DHH](http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/2012/rails-is-omakase.html) with
Ruby on Rails, but the more recent trend is letting those projects go: Ryan
Dahl leaving node.js, Jeremy Resig leaving jQuery, and many of `_why`'s projects
resuscitated and reworked by Steve Klabnik.

Open source doesn't work the way I thought it would:
spontaneous contributors are rare, and there's a continuum among
users and coders in terms of understanding, maturity, interest, and expectations.

A goal in 2013 is to find new ways to make this work. I didn't realize until
late 2012 the importance of project-materials like well-thought-out `README`
files, and I think there's more low-hanging fruit in terms of contributability.

Sam Stephenson's [article](http://sstephenson.us/posts/you-are-not-your-code) also
hit home - I've worked on a mix of projects founded (CartoCSS, Wax, etc.) and adopted
(Modest Maps, iD). Some have succeeded beyond what I expected - CartoCSS was
originally intended to be equivalent to Cascadenik, and now likely has many more
users. But others are slowly falling into question - three years ago, OpenLayers
was the kind of Javascript libraries and Modest Maps held a lot of promise.
Now Leaflet is far in the lead, with 3.5k stars in comparison to OpenLayers's
~700 and Modest Maps's ~310.

You could draw multiple lessons from this -
that certain code styles are more easily accepted, or that there was a lack
of accessibility in terms of documentation and examples that could have been
improved.

Momentum and identity in open source is funny - the ubiquity
of jQuery being a great example of something that's so thoroughly adopted
that the `$` is _expected_ and provides a sort of cargo-cult ignorance of
advanced Javascript idioms and native browser behavior.

You could distill it into a versus. Last month, this blog
received the following search queries: 'openlayers vs leaflet',
'javascript object literal vs module pattern', and 'cartocss vs mapcss'.
I'll never write these articles.

I'm also realizing how attachment can come and go. A few years ago, I was
strongly invested in my work on the [Drupal OpenLayers module](http://drupal.org/project/openlayers),
and even defended Drupal from time to time. Now it is a distant glimmer
in the past and, one could say, a source of 'life lessons' on how to
manage code and people. I also wrote TileLive, the server that powered huge sites
and explored the 'dynamic generation' angle, is two or three years stale,
superceded in every way by newer technology.

## Thinking about Digital-Physical

There is a recent trend to incarnate the digital - printing
code history like Craig Mod or the BERG [Little Printer](http://bergcloud.com/littleprinter/),
or designing complex infographics like and producing them as [beautifully
laser-cut paper](http://theluxuryofprotest.com/Everyone_Ever_in_the_World.html),
or even 3D-printing a vinyl record.

I think it is primarily a smart way to feel scale in the way we are used to, to
comment on potential versus physical permanence, and to play with the differences
in representation, like accuracy and resolution, between digital and analog forms.

In some ways, this is inspiring: I have a printed book of my tweets from
[Etherpress](http://www.ether-press.com/) which I treasure.
Reading months of sentences, with fads, breakups,
projects, and all life's junk is interesting. But I have concerns.

_Digital-Physical items are for rich people_. The Little Printer is Â£199.
[Everyone Ever in the World](http://theluxuryofprotest.com/Everyone_Ever_in_the_World.html) is a limited edition, no longer available.
And although Craig Mod doesn't give their costs for the Flipboard book,
their main reference point is [Christo and Jean-Claude's Umbrellas](http://christojeanneclaude.net/projects/the-umbrellas),
a $26 million
art project. To print your own vinyl record, you need a high-end 3D printer
that costs $250,000.

But at the same time there are less-lauded and more popular projects like
[printstagr.am](http://printstagr.am/) and Apple's [Cards](http://www.apple.com/apps/cards/)
which have surprisingly wide reach.

And when proponents of book-scale and 3D printed visualizations talk about
digital scale, there's _a sense of uniformity that doesn't match up to the
experience_. Where a hundred gigabyte hard disk is the same size as
a disk with thirty times more storage, let's not forget about the popularity
of Google's [server farm tours](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2219188/Inside-Google-pictures-gives-look-8-vast-data-centres.html),
in which journalists walk past aisle after
aisle of polished servers in A/C controlled basements somewhere in rural
America. Miniaturization is in everyone's pocket because it is
accompanied the displacement from your person to the sitting army of storage.

I wonder about these principles, like the idea of physical substance as proof.
Novels are printed on thick paper with rough-cut edges to assert their
substance. And substance as a sort of scarcity: the physical world has limited
editions, online we have sites where you can only post once a week or your
photo fades in a few seconds.
