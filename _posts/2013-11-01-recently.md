## Watching

* [Bruce Schneier @ Congress on Privacy & Security](http://slideshot.epfl.ch/play/cops_schneier)
* [Ludwig II](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2180463/): honestly all over the place
  but [quite a story to back it up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_II_of_Bavaria).

## Listening

Recently, it's been a ton of hip-hop and rap. I'm not sure whether it's because
there have been a few hit albums recently or a few friends who have given
great recommendations, or the [RapGenius](http://rapgenius.com/) way of listening
has actually changed how I think about lyrics.

## Thinking

This month, [MapBox got funded to the tune of 10M](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/10million-funding-foundry-group/),
and we announced [some of](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/sean-gillies-joins-mapbox/)
[the first](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/nicki-dlugash-joins-mapbox)
[additions](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/eric-fischer-joins-mapbox/) as a result.

It's pretty exciting. Working at [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/)
and [Development Seed](http://developmentseed.org/) has been my only real
job, and it's awesome, thanks to masterminds who get it, like [Eric Gundersen](https://twitter.com/ericg)
and [Young Hahn](http://developmentseed.org/team/young-hahn/).
