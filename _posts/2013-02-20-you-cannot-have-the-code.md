You cannot have a digital copy of the DC Code. You cannot have a public domain
version of the code, despite it being legally [public domain](http://macwright.org/2013/02/14/the-law-is-public-domain.html).

The Code is the 'compiled law' of the District of Columbia: gun laws,
bike laws, election rules, and most everything else.

The DC Government does not have a digital copy of the DC Code that
it can give you, even if you ask nicely. It does not have a copy for
itself, beside hardcover books and copyrighted CDs that it can't legally copy or crack.
There's no clear backup plan if a contractorâ€™s lights go off or server
farm goes down - while a contract requires them to have backups,
there's no guarantee.

The DC government can't make a pocket copy of the code, or a smartphone app
to better inform policemen, because it doesn't have a copyright-free copy.
Open source developers can't make better data portals for the code because
they don't either.

The refrain from open-government advocates is that one should 'ask for a copy'.

You cannot. There is no-one to ask who can give you one and who wants to. The government
only has copyright-infected copies, and the contractor has no reason to
endanger their information monopoly.

To preclude misunderstandings: this is **not a failure of the Council** itself.
It has nothing to do with the drama around councilmembers or the DC government's problems.

The Council [composes and publishes its bills](http://macwright.org/2013/02/11/the-code-written.html)
and makes every effort at transparency: this is a failure of the last step,
in which the bill is [compiled and de-facto owned by a private contractor](http://macwright.org/2013/02/13/the-code-compiled.html).

This is _not a question of hacking or technology._ Writing a scraper for
the portal is an afternoon project, but is illegal, and can be construed
as a felony by the federal government.

This is a failure of the public/private contracting system and the
_government's ability to write strong and precise contracts that
are geared for the internet era_.

This is a failure of [Westlaw](http://www.westlaw.com/) and
[LexisNexis](http://www.lexisnexis.com/). It's possibly a reiteration of a
[well-known court case](http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/West_Publishing_Co._v._Mead_Data_Central,_Inc.)
focused on their previous attempt to do the same thing:
monetize what should be a basic unit of democracy.

Next up: how this is possible, what it means, and how we can fix it.
