You cannot have a digital copy of the DC Code. You cannot have a public domain
version of the code, despite it being [legally public domain](http://macwright.org/2013/02/14/the-law-is-public-domain.html).

The DC Government does not have a digital copy of the DC Code that
it can give you, even if you ask nicely. It does not have a copy for
itself, beside copyrighted CDs that it can't legally copy or crack.
The government itself does not maintain its own laws or have a backup plan if a
contractorâ€™s lights go off.

The DC government can't make a pocket copy of the code, or a smartphone app
to better inform policemen, because it doesn't have a copyright-free copy.
Open source developers can't make better data portals for the code because
they don't either.

The refrain from open-government advocates is that one should 'ask for a copy'.

You cannot. There is no-one to ask who can give you one and who wants to. The government
only has copyright-infected copies, and the contractor has no reason to
endanger their information monopoly.

To preclude misunderstandings: this is **not a failure of the Council** itself.
It has nothing to do with the drama around councilmembers or the DC government's problems.

This is **not a question of hacking or technology.** Writing a scraper for
the portal is an afternoon project, but is illegal, and can be construed
as a felony by the federal government.

This is a failure of the public/private contracting system and the
**government's ability to write strong and precise contracts that
are geared for the internet era**.

This is a failure of [Westlaw](http://www.westlaw.com/) and
[LexisNexis](http://www.lexisnexis.com/) to prioritize anything but their
profitability. It's possibly a reiteration of a
[well-known court case](http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/West_Publishing_Co._v._Mead_Data_Central,_Inc.)
focused on their previous attempt to do the same thing:
monetize what should be a basic unit of democracy.
