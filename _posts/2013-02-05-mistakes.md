[Mistakes is a tool for teaching Javascript to people](http://macwright.org/mistakes/),
mostly on projectors.

You type Javascript on the left, and it echoes the results of an expression
on the right, per-line. There's not a lot of [magic](https://github.com/tmcw/mistakes/blob/gh-pages/js/site.js):
it works as you'd expect, with `eval()`, `slice()`, and so on. The only nitpicky
tweak required is to give eval scope, so that loops like `for (var i = 0...` don't
clobber the `i` variable that mistakes relies on.

It supports [loading from GitHub Gists](http://macwright.org/mistakes/#4679533), using
[CORS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing). There's
also a `require()` function built in that takes a URL of a Javascript
file and will include it for you to use. It's not [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/):
it's [much simpler](https://github.com/tmcw/mistakes/blob/gh-pages/js/site.js#L11).

There's plenty of prior art: [bl.ocks.org](http://bl.ocks.org/),
[tributary.io](http://tributary.io/), and [glsl sandbox](http://glsl.heroku.com/)
all pull content from gists, and [SLIME](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SLIME)
and others have pioneered the idea of running code while writing it.
I find the `mistakes` system for this to be pretty intuitive: instead of
having a magic keybinding to evaluate code and to have a mental model
of what's evaluated, it's very simple: if you have the lines

    var a = 1;
    var b = 2;
    a + b;

It simply evaluates them in order: line 0, line 0 to 1, line 0 to 2. For
me, that's pretty easy to think about and talk about.

If there's a syntax error, nothing is printed. I could use something like
[Esprima](http://esprima.org/) to be smarter here, but it's not the focus.

Same with sliders ala [worrydream prototypes](http://worrydream.com/) -
we have a saying at [MapBox](http://mapbox.com/) when faced with abstractions
of input (preprocessors, typing modes, so on): typing is not the problem.

Anyway, it's a thing I wanted and it didn't exist yet: there's [LightTable](http://www.chris-granger.com/2012/04/12/light-table---a-new-ide-concept/)
coming at some point, and plenty of things for doing JS, but mostly
focused on Javascript that does stuff to pages, so aimed at demoing
your new tab library and so on. This exists and is useful for demonstrating
JS itself, explaining stuff like closures, callbacks, etc, in a useful way.

I've been using it to [demonstrate JS gotchas](http://macwright.org/mistakes/#4711100), and
[teach tough concepts from d3](http://macwright.org/mistakes/#4679425), and more.

And so [mistakes](http://macwright.org/mistakes/) is a tool for teaching
Javascript to people, mostly on projectors. Try it out.
