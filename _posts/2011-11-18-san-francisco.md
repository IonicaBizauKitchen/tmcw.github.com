This time I got to explore a lot more of San Francisco, thanks to my friends
[Tom](http://artistsmoving.com/) and [Jesse](http://germinativesolutions.com/).
And, of course, there's a little bit of internet evidence of this fact:
I use [TrackMe](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/trackme/id454704336?mt=8)
to re-add something like [the iPhone tracking bug Alisdair discovered](http://radar.oreilly.com/2011/04/apple-location-tracking.html) to my phone.
It's pretty far from real GPS tracks, but neat for an overview
of locations, and it's pretty easy to GPX-export and `ogr2ogr` into
something usable by [TileMill](http://mapbox.com/tilemill).

Plus, it was an excuse to try out [HighRoad](http://github.com/migurski/HighRoad),
Michal Migurski's awe-inspiring SQL hack to make logical, zoom-based, organized
roads from `osm2pgsql` data. It was quick to set up and made my whole
PostGIS-using experience so much more pleasant.

The main accomplishment was biking [from San Francisco to Santa Cruz](http://g.co/maps/ussrm), on Highway One.
It's about 85 miles, and probably more, given the fact that Brian and I get lost pretty often.
Luckily we had ridiculous [rented](http://www.sportsbasement.com/) road bikes
and enough gear to make the trip a bit less painful, but it is no simple feat,
especially considering Sharp Park Road, which is shoulderless and unthinkably
fast.
But, it's highly recommended. Take it easy, eat a big breakfast
(I missed that one), and it's an awesome journey.

San Francisco is a pretty incredible place - I spent some time at
[Art Explosion](http://www.theartexplosion.com//art/index.php) with [Tom](http://artistsmoving.com/),
who is developing his [mixed-media work](http://www.flickr.com/photos/56797643@N03/sets/72157625612760304/).
It has an excellent roof. I also happened to meet [Eric Fischer](http://www.flickr.com/photos/walkingsf/),
whose exhibition [There Be Dragons](http://www.squarecylinder.com/2011/11/there-be-dragons-intersection-for-the-arts/) I attended last time I was in town.

Beyond that, hung out at [stamen](http://stamen.com) and worked a bit
on [modestmaps](https://github.com/stamen/modestmaps-js) with some
[wizards](mbostock.github.com/d3) of the [trade](http://maps.grammata.com/).
There's a lot of stuff cooking there, and it'll be awesome
to apply it to the [MapBox](http://mapbox.com/) stack. Mainly it'll
be interesting to finally get a 1.0.0 of modestmaps and start a true
documentation push, and make it clearer that it's not just some
actionscript library.
