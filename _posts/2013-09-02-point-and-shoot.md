The increasing structural complexity of open projects reframes userbase growth
as a threat rather than a boon for success.

[OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) is a collaborative map project.
Like Wikipedia, it's created and owned by a large base of unpaid collaborators
and accurate because of community process rather than oversight and control.

Like text needs a tool for editing, like Microsoft Word or a `<textarea>` element
on the web, maps need editors. We saw OpenStreetMap's existing editors and saw
room for growth - [JOSM](http://josm.openstreetmap.de/) is a massive, intimdating
Java application, whereas [Potlatch 2](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Potlatch_2)
is a homely Flash-powered project.

In short, map data is an inherently global resource, and existing tools would
only empower a small set of potential collaborators.

So, mid-2013, the [iD editor project](http://ideditor.com/) was gearing up for launch on
[OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/).
The functionality was sufficient for most and few people commented on details
like design and internal architecture.

Instead of technical feedback, the protests against iD were cultural and theoretical:
new tools enable new users to do things we only trust ourselves to do.

clicks from the home page and an new contributor's first action with OSM
could be to accidentally delete something!

destructively.

## Permission and Ability

One of the most interesting parts of explaining OpenStreetMap is answering the
inevitable 'permission' question: can a new user just delete data from the map?

Can _anyone_ really change the map? It's a reasonable expectation coming
from the GIS world obsessed with authenticity, permission, and authority,
to think that some parallel to these values will exist elsewhere, but the truth
is that, in this case, it doesn't. Or, rather, it doesn't directly.

"You can edit 1 mile around roads you've driven". This is [Waze](http://www.waze.com/)'s
map editing interface.

"Your Edit Was Approved". This is [Google Map Maker](http://www.google.com/mapmaker),
with an unimportant change.
