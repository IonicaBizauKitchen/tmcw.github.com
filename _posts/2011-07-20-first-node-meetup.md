Last night [we hosted](http://bit.ly/p2fA8t) the first Node meetup in DC.
[Paul](http://bit.ly/otztrD) took great video and
photos of the whole event, and I'd declare it a success: there are, after all,
some really cool tech people in Washington. It takes a while to scroll our
[Flickr back to the good old days of Drupal meetups](http://bit.ly/oGjyUY) at
Stetsons, but this feels like a different ballgame - the few people who are
using [node.js](http://nodejs.com) for real are working on really cool stuff,
and those just dropping in learn quickly that this isn't buzzword-driven yet.

It'll be a little while until node has the same kind of momentum as Drupal -
few people call themselves 'node shops' whereas DC has at least 3 'Drupal
shops' even after our departure.

And, [Will](http://bit.ly/nKeQDS), our in-house film genius, used
[my song inin](http://bit.ly/qc2DyT) as the soundtrack for the video! Pretty cool,
and [this video had another Pueblo song](http://vimeo.com/24702115) (called
[We Looked Nice On TV](http://pueblo.bandcamp.com/track/we-looked-nice-on-tv)) in it.
