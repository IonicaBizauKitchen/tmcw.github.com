> mere conventional topographic Photography-map making & skeleton rendering of
feature & form without the roundness & fulness of force & feature that modelling
of flesh & limb which the focus I use can only give tho' called and condemned
as "_out of focus_". What is focus-& who has a right to say what focus is the
legitimate focus-My aspirations are to ennoble Photography and to secure for it
the character and uses of High Art by combining the real & ideal & sacrificing
nothing of Truth by all possible devotion to Poetry & Beauty-

I should have known about her much earlier, but only via
[The History of Photography](http://amzn.to/rehMVV) did I find out about Cameron,
who is basically mesmerizing in terms of output and story. She started with
photography at age 48 and had this feeling of personal relationship with the
subject - trying to make people look better with soft-focus portraits and the like.

> Are we to have another century of guitar when the best instrument
in the world is still the piano?

[Junior](http://www.kakiking.com/releases/junior) is Kaki King's proper
guns-blazing grand introduction to rock music, but this was her first shot at
singing on a record, and it's at that wonderful tipping point where there are
clearly still quite a few ideas going, and enough freedom to include both
an 8 minute anthem and a 2 minute slide-guitar ditty. And the wittiness of
'Never Said I Loved You' is ever-relevant and irreplaceable. As evidenced by
the preceding quote - King in _Second Brain_, singing from her vantage point
as the most prominent woman guitar virtuoso of her time.

## _[The Distant Lover](http://www.amazon.com/Distant-Lover-Christoph-Hein/dp/0679728988)_ (1990, Christoph Hein)

> When I was lying there in my old bed, Mother came in. She sat down on the edge
of the bed and said we had to talk, there were so many things we never talked
about. I said I didn't understand what she meant. She looked sad and asked
why I was so cold to her, so unloving. I protested mildly, but without
conviction, simply to avoid a quarrel.

The one-word review on the cover describes this novel accurately: _"devastating"_.
This one takes a different sort of effort on the part of the reader - it's short
and spare, and can be a page-turner at times, but it takes a toll. Hein dispatches
boredom, numbness, and quiet agony interchangeably, capturing the mood of a time
and the danger of modernity while instilling the urge to call ones parents and
hug a friend as soon as possible.
