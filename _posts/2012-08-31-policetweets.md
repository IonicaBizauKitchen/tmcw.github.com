  <a href='http://macwright.org/stories/policetweets/'>police tweets is a project about @DCPoliceDept</a>

The [DC Police](http://mpdc.dc.gov/mpdc/site/default.asp) made the unpopular
decision to [encrypt their radio communications](http://wamu.org/news/11/08/26/dc_police_to_encrypt_radio_communications.php),
with [no exceptions for journalists](http://dcist.com/2011/11/lanier_defends_police_radio_encrypt.php),
and instead maintain [@DCPoliceDept](https://twitter.com/DCPoliceDept),
which includes short synopses of ongoing crimes.
It's a big shift in medium, that arises from the popularity of
radio tracker apps for cell phones.

What was previously non-corporate, realtime, and evanescent is now tied to
[a controversial system](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/17/twitter-changes-incite-online-protests/)
that actually creates a potential to archive and analyze,
but also a norm of filtering and uncertain threats of shutdown.

DC is unusual place: a non-state with [staggering inequality](http://dcist.com/2012/03/dc_near_top_in_income_inequality.php)
and poor leadership.
[Mayor Vincent Gray](http://mayor.dc.gov/) has [a 29% approval rating](http://www.washingtonpost.com/page/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2012/07/19/National-Politics/Polling/release_105.xml?uuid=Fa-LwtE9EeGDaqQyOKJ2fQ),
while the DC police have previously instituted [unconstitutional checkpoints](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/10/AR2009071002750.html)
and [camera seizures](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/07/one-day-after-dc-polices-reasonable-camera-policy-phones-still-taken/).

This visualization, if you can call it that, with its anemic bar graphs -
tries to do a few things. It catalogues 3,331 tweets and makes them available
as simple [JSON](http://www.json.org/) for further work.

But most importantly it is _open-ended_: the topic is the choice of the user.

You can see the data on the left, and notice a pattern, and investigate it
on your own: a coworker made a [query about beards](http://bit.ly/OM9Ory),
or you could look at [shirt variations](http://bit.ly/OM9VmI). This chooses
text as its axis and pivots on that, allowing for both extremely custom
cases, like finding [mentions of DC's quadrants](bit.ly/NZj4vf), but without
having a complex data model or really any user-interface.
