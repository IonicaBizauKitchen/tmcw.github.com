Right now I'm on a [Megabus](http://us.megabus.com/) back from New York City to Washington DC. I just
gave a talk at a conference called [Visualized](http://visualized.com/) about my running maps and work on
seeing the progress of [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/)'s attempt to redo several hundreds of
years of building roads in seven or eight years of typing and drawing on
computers.

The talk went okay; it was nothing to write home about. I'm relieved to be
finished with it, since the lineup and fit-and-finish of the conference was
intimidating in a way that replicated the pre-cross-country-race fidgety
nervousness that doomed my high school athletic pursuits.

Anyway, that's done now. The only interesting thing I really said was
at the after-party, where I professed a love of Microsoft Excel and a hatred
of professional criticism and then did a lackluster job of supporting that
point.

Here's that point, anyway. This is unlikely to be one of those pieces with the
perfect mix of poignant and inane and the perfect end-loop - read Paul Ford
or Aaron Straup Cope instead.

<hr />

Microsoft Excel is the folk tradition of data visualization and our current
strategy of making charts and graphs unique and technical does not have a proper
focus on what folk is.

This is a loose idea of what folk is, in the context of these words; it's
guaranteed to miss the academic definition and using folk as the term for these
attributes does not imply that it is the first or only object to encapsulate
them.

Folk is guitars, now. At earlier points in history, it was the violin, the
banjo, dulcimer, lute, and so on. Guitars are popular enough to be boring,
limited in their ability to play interlocking melodies like the piano or
manipulate the entire life of a played note like the flute. But they're
inexpensive, durable, loud, and a shockingly effective tool of communication.

Please don't cringe at the use of 'communication' like I just did when I typed
it. This isn't to say communication as-in communicating emotions, wooing
beloveds, and so on; it's communication as in copying. Making music is a series
of abstractions upon the basic idea of sound: waveform, notation, key, song
structure, chord fingerings, vocal technique, and instrument itself are some of
the levels.

Reductionism is always possible; sounds are the lowest level,
copiable and subject to analysis in themselves; but this isn't a practical
way to look at music if you want to create it. Creating music starts
in the opposite direction: playing guitar means that you can copy from more
people, take lessons from the guy down the street and imitate YouTube videos
in your bedroom.

Guitar is a folk instrument because it's a popular abstraction that lets people
communicate.

When I say copying, I mean this: authorship in a folk tradition is about
creative force rather than creative origin. A girl I went to school with
is now a [popular folk ballad singer](https://www.facebook.com/annaandelizabeth) known for her incredible commitment
to learning tradition on a both academic and instinctive level. When she
performs a song, she notes not only the original author, if known, but the
author of that particular version, and, if any, the performer that she
learned her performance from.

By inverting authorship, tradition sustains it.

<hr />

Linux is a folk movement. It's the obvious example, and the paragraph writes
itself; communities post help for each other, adapt each other's work, and
eventually create a sense of tradition that goes beyond any material or
informational work and is more a way of continuing.

But so is Photoshop. It doesn't matter that Photoshop technically costs
hundreds of dollars or that the thing itself is not as mutable as Linux.
There are millions of Photoshop tutorials on the Internet that are all
a means of sharing, and useful because of this shared abstraction.

<hr />

The inverse of this idea isn't as clear; is there anything like an instrument
or a program that is not a folk instrument? It's not easy to say, but what is
clear is a sort of tension.

The first source of tension is medium.

The talks at Visualized ranged from people who have created software that
was downloadable during the talk, to an artist who created [a certain work](http://theluxuryofprotest.com/) in
vinyl, laser-cut paper, and frosted plastic. Of those who push pixels, the gap
between the Illustrator & Photoshop crowd and the code crowd was significant.

It's easy to talk about certain specifics of medium; the digital artists
lusting after high-resolution printing that makes serifs & tiny charts possible,
and the print artists after interactivity that attracts larger audiences (or
shunning this desire by calling it pandering, or unproductive).

But there are some other differences.

Physical media makes everything seem far away. After one talk which mentioned
the transition from print to digital, I tweeted that 'The Internet makes
everything seem similar', and Brandon Martin-Anderson summarized that idea
much better: 'The internet makes everything smell like the room my computer is in'.
Physical presentation is not only filled with more cues, like your having
to drive to a gallery or the price of a wall-art, but it also presents context
in a vastly different way; a poster on the wall can cite influences by name,
but the viewer can't ctrl-` though tabs to see what influence really means.

The Internet flips this; like the geographic principle that things closer
together are more related to each other, the Internet's collapse of everything
into a flat index means that simultaneous invention is the norm. Everything
new will be notified of its predecessor a comment on the post.

Copying is different. The sweeping term covers everything from being taught and
copying knowledge from a professor to redesigning an interface and copying
what you don't create.

As more design is dictated by computation - and I see no sign of this trend
reversing - the profession will have to grapple with the concept of copying
in a way quite different from copying-as-false-authorship.

The clearest example I can think of is tutorials versus libraries. The idea
of tutorials is well-known, but for the non-software initiated, a library
is a set of functionality, like tools to create graphics or do math,
that can be shared by multiple 'applications'. For instance, browsers
and desktop games can and do share libraries for networking and graphics.

Using a library and following a tutorial are ways of building on the work of
others; smaller problems, like how to do a fast fourier transform or how to
pan-sharpen images are more common and more shared than the larger ideas that
tend to be thought of as 'the final work'.

But the feel different. In programming, you install a library easily and can
more or less ignore its internal works, authorship, and particulars while taking
advantage of the time saved. This is because, to get a statistics library,
I type `npm install -g simple-statistics` and to use it I type `require('simple-statistics')`
and I'm done; it's not performative, it's declarative: I want this, and then it is.

Following a tutorial is different: there's no script that you can copy & paste;
you mime the actions of the person who created the tutorial, read their
narrative, understand the problem area just a little bit more. You feel helped,
but instead of feeling like you're using someone's work, you feel like you've
learned someone's technique, and I think that's a real difference.

I'll circle back someday. Okay, here it is:

A great deal of the visualization community's energy is expended in criticism
and avoidance. We now know that [rainbow scales](http://blog.visual.ly/rainbow-color-scales/), [nonzero axes](http://vis4.net/blog/posts/doing-the-line-charts-right/), pie charts,
3D charts, all-at-once transitions, [RGB interpolation](http://vis4.net/blog/posts/choropleth-maps/), big numbers,
choropleths for absolutes, scaled points for relatives, bubble charts,
and, of course the spherical mercator projection, are bad, evil terrible
things. Our recent heroes like Tufte and Bertin had cautionary lessons about
the limitations of understanding and the dangers of complexity. They have
been for the most part Reformation-era purifiers instead of Renaissance-era
creators.

Anyway, I like Excel. I like it because there are tutorials all over the
internet for how to use it. I like it because it enables people who are neither
designers nor developers to create things. I like it because it isn't
intimidating: one of Aaron Straup Cope's recent bits where he talks about
how Flickr failed at being a place where everyone felt welcome to create
and Instagram succeeded.

It's important that people create, even if they aren't good at it. Having
created a thing makes you look at the thing differently. If you've ever
copied a master painting in art class you not only know that painting better
than you've ever known a painting, but you can then look paintings as
makeable things, as an interaction between skill, ability, materials, environment,
and so on.

The chorus of visualization experts is that this should save us from boring
charts; that we have suffered long under mediocre aesthetics and poor design
and now it is time to move beyond. I don't believe this. The relevance
design in charts and even the idea that we _need_ custom-designed charts
is because bad tools like Microsoft Excel made visualization normal; they
turned a specific, cloistered practice into someting that we can picture
in our heads and feel like we understand.

So popularity, normality, and mediocrity aren't things to be eliminated;
they fill out any real tradition.

And so I guess I should conjure some take-aways.

The critical view of visualization is negative, and should only
be the counterpoint to creation, not the center of attention by itself. Like
the typographer's collective witchhunt of Comic Sans, criticism has given us
something to hate but nothing to love - and much less to say about what we do
love.

Knee-jerk criticism over specific parts of visualization rather than the
end-result communication ability is insider ball at best and puritanical
at worst. If something perceptually imperfect draws attention in a way that
the visual-truth version could never, it seems best to communicate and be heard
rather than not.

This month I'm recording an album of some folk and some electronic music.
It's bound to be pretty bad, but the thing
that excites me most is that two of my good friends are also going to try
writing and recording an album.

I would rather that happen than to [just leave it to talented and beautiful people.](http://hmtpng.com/)
