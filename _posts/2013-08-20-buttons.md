For years, I saw the consumerization<sup><small><a href='#consumerization'>1</a></small></sup> of computers as a decision passed down from
corporations.

![Computers in 1980s and 2010s](http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3793/9533899268_4952094a37_h.jpg)

And it made sense. The optimal user in the eyes of industry is a
user of major social networks,
a buyer of apps: a person for whom expectations of technology
have drifted from power to simplicity.

But the third or fourth time watching [The Future of Programming](http://vimeo.com/71278954),
after [the](http://vimeo.com/64895205) [preceding](http://vimeo.com/66085662)
[series](http://vimeo.com/67076984) by [Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com/),
I saw more.

The task of changing the way people think about computing is in the hands
of people like you and me - there's no establishment prevent progress besides
the enforcement of norms by a community.

And where we're at is a point of stunted development - using computers
creatively is still unnecessarily hard, unjustly handicapping people
with great ideas but neither time nor the '[symbol manipulation](http://worrydream.com/KillMath/)' skills
currently required to 'become programmers.'

## Creativity

Technology is naturally an instrument of efficiency:
rarely is there more than a second between a person's request for some total,
average, or search, and a computer's production of a result.

In this way, efficiency is simple: one person defines one operation and
refines it to perfection.

Creativity requires something more. Not just polishing a single path,
but determining the minimal universal set of building blocks.
Building creative tools is deciding the dimension of a Lego.

## Typing Everything

Like the [AI winter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter),
the idea of computers being user-friendly in ways beyond being 'simple' is a
fascination that comes and goes and is currently gone.

Right now I'm trying this in [vim](http://www.vim.org/), a twenty-one year
old text editor with notoriously difficult user-experience choices: to quit,
a user must type `:wq`. To delete this paragraph, I type `<escape>vjjd`.
It makes sense after a while, or so they say. When I'm done, it's commited
with [git](http://git-scm.com/), a CLI-centric tool for managing source code,
and pushed to [GitHub](https://github.com/), where it's compiled with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
and the text-based [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) content
is processed into HTML with templates.

_Five years ago, I would go to [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) and press 'Save'._

To generate a visualization, I usually break out [d3js](http://d3js.org/),
a low-level Javascript library that expects at a minimum knowledge of
[SVG](http://macwright.org/2013/06/25/just-enough-svg.html),
[data joining](http://macwright.org/presentations/dcjq/), [HTML](http://macwright.org/2013/07/07/d3-for-html.html),
and CSS. Either that, or I'll use [node-canvas](https://github.com/learnboost/node-canvas),
which requires [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) proficiency and a solid dose
of trigonometry in order to do anything interesting.

_Ten years ago, I would open Excel, make a chart, and press 'Save'._

## Precision and Control

![Espresso Machine](http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3693/9531287575_60c98800ad_h.jpg)

There's a beauty to removing abstraction, to low-maintenance
[fixies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-gear_bicycle)
and the resurgence of the [straight razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_razor).

But is it useful to remove abstraction when it exposes a much larger surface
of unrelated complexity? If an artist has an idea of a beautiful visualization,
should they spend a year learning JavaScript? And is that startup cost reasonable,
like the time invested in learning the way paint mixes?

<iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/5047563?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="640" height="352" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe> <p><a href="http://vimeo.com/5047563">ART && CODE Symposium: Hackety Hack, why the lucky stiff</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/sfci">STUDIO for Creative Inquiry</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

[_why](http://vimeo.com/5047563), his presentation at art && code, referred
to the 'learn web programming' argument as unreasonable - for people just
starting to understand programming, why learn three inter-connected
languages at once?

Is it even reasonable or useful to recommend people learn a computer language to
complete basic tasks like drawing a picture or running a calculation? While
we have [better resources than ever before](http://www.codecademy.com/) to learn programming,
programming hasn't changed in years, and the basic assumption of those writing
languages, libraries and more is that they _write tools for people who know programming already_.

Only a few examples, like Mary Rose Cooke's [Isla](https://github.com/maryrosecook/islaclj) and
Alan Kay's [Squeak](http://www.squeak.org/) languages are written for anyone
other than an adult with lots of time on their hands.

## The Unhappy Simplicity of Choices

And so the positive argument is to make things visible, to reconsider and eliminate
historical complexity. In other words, to fight for simple and easy.

There are different kinds of easy.

There's the easy of choosing the right thing: this is the land of presets,
of 'builders' that are just glorified [wizard patterns](http://ui-patterns.com/patterns/Wizard),
with the same baked in assumption: 'a single goal'. This is what you can see in
tools like [Highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com/products/highcharts),
that attempt to build 'all possible variations' and invite you to choose one.

Anyone can guess the ending - opinionated software
is only cool if you have cool opinions, and even then presets will never capture
creativity.

![Charts](http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3722/9533924560_f504e86159_h.jpg)

[d3](http://d3js.org/) takes a different approach. It's a visualization library that grapples
with the fact that _visualizations have very little in common with each other_:
the 'atoms' of d3, the lowest-level 'things' you can do, are very low-level.
At the most basic level, you're drawing lines, polygons, text, and primitives.
Abstractions above these things, like axes and charts, can be broken down,
decomposed as necessary.

This makes d3 hard, and makes some things 'more complicated' in comparison
to libraries that correctly guess what you want and 'have it already'. But
instead of fighting assumptions and instead of hiding complexity in them,
d3 successfully tackles nearly the entire 'visualization space' and, after
the initial brain-crunch, is actually simpler to understand deeply.

## Interface Atoms

<iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/66085662?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe> <p><a href="http://vimeo.com/66085662">Drawing Dynamic Visualizations</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/worrydream">Bret Victor</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

The demo in this video is interesting because it's so fundamental.

A simpler, easier thing to implement would have a person dragging data onscreen,
the software automatically chooses 20 chart types that seem right, and then
present a limited set of options. Not only would this be much easier to do,
but it would result in fewer clicks, a shorter learning curve, and an easier
thing to sell.

But that would be doing it wrong - that would result in the same contained,
handicapped experimentation as we've had in years of bad wizard user interfaces.
Instead, the basic units of this demo are on the level of d3 - unopinioned
visual elements that can be composed into a much larger and more diverse set of outcomes.

## Next

I've started on minor work that pushes in this direction - that tries to
make 'user interface' elements behave like code and to enable 'users' to
think more like coders, the way they already think when writing Excel macros
or meal recipes.

And it's hard. Libraries like [jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/) have faded in importance and attention
and in their place we have tools like [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
that embrace 'content as king' and punt on user interaction beyond
clicking buttons.

This isn't an immediate need for me, nor is it a simple thing that can
be packaged up into a trendy JavaScript library. In between thinking these
thoughts and having something usable, it's a lot of building difficult
things from scratch with little to show for it. And there are numerous distractions
and skeletons of previous efforts along the path - after all, visual programming
is a 1960s idea that hasn't stuck yet.

But I can't picture anything more interesting to work on at this point. It has
been stunning to see people exploit what little means of expression are exposed
on the web, despite the efforts of industry and programmers to restrict us
to 140 chars and [sanitized](https://twitter.com/glitchr_) ASCII text.

Or that it seems unimaginative to constrain creativity to inputs
and outputs designed by others and assume that the true power of computers -
programmability - is something to be exploited by the select few.

<ul>
<li id='consumerization'>that is, the way that new computers emphasize consumption
of premade content over the creation of new content, and present software as a
completed thing with no way to poke around at the inside and understand how things
work.</li>
</ul>
