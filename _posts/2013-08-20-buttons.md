For years, I saw the consumerization of computers as a thing done to us.

And it made sense. The optimal user in the eyes of industry is a
user of major social networks,
a buyer of apps: a person for whom expectations of technology
have drifted from power to simplicity.

## What We Make

We as developers make libraries and we make software.

If anything visualization has become harder, not easier, thanks to a focus
on control: we've moved from drip coffee to artisinal espresso.

Programmers have an idea of 'sensible defaults' that runs deep, popularized
recently by Ruby on Rails, a library that made many assumptions about purpose
and ran with them.

I've thought on that level for years, thinking that the decision 'baked' into
work simplify interfaces and communicate better.

The important part of d3 is not any feature, or a slick API - it's that it
reached the correct level of abstraction in order to be both powerful
and flexible.
