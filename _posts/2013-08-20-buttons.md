For years, I saw the consumerization of computers as a decision passed down from
corporations.

![Computers in 1980s and 2010s](http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3793/9533899268_4952094a37_h.jpg)

And it made sense. The optimal user in the eyes of industry is a
user of major social networks,
a buyer of apps: a person for whom expectations of technology
have drifted from power to simplicity.

But the third or forth time through watching [The Future of Programming](http://vimeo.com/71278954),
after [the](http://vimeo.com/64895205) [preceding](http://vimeo.com/66085662)
[series](http://vimeo.com/67076984) by [Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com/),
I kind of got it: the bifurcation of people into developers and users is false, and the way
that we enforce our expectations of 'users' reinforces the gap.

There's an expression that programmers try to work themselves out of work -
to automate every problem, to 'finish the job'. As time goes by, I become more
convinced that the only way to do this is by changing the task of coding.

## Creativity

Technology is naturally an instrument of efficiency:
rarely is there more than a second between a person's request for some total,
average, or search, and a computer's production of a result.

Creativity requires something more - not just polishing a single path,
but determining the smallest, most flexible set of building blocks for the
widest range of possibilities. Building creative tools is deciding the dimension
of a Lego.

## Typing Everything

Like the [AI winter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter),
the idea of computers being user-friendly in ways beyond being 'simple' is a
fascination that comes and goes, and has currently gone.

Right now I'm trying this in [vim](http://www.vim.org/), a twenty-one year
old text editor with notoriously difficult user-experience choices: to quit,
a user must type `:wq`. To delete this paragraph, I type `<escape>vjjd`.
It makes sense after a while, or so they say. When I'm done, it's commited
with [git](http://git-scm.com/), a CLI-centric tool for managing source code,
and pushed to [GitHub](https://github.com/), where it's compiled with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
and the text-based [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) content
is processed into HTML with templates.

_Five years ago, I would go to [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) and press 'Save'._

To generate a visualization, I usually break out [d3js](http://d3js.org/),
a low-level Javascript library that expects at a minimum knowledge of
[SVG](http://macwright.org/2013/06/25/just-enough-svg.html),
[data joining](http://macwright.org/presentations/dcjq/), [HTML](http://macwright.org/2013/07/07/d3-for-html.html),
and CSS. Either that, or I'll use [node-canvas](https://github.com/learnboost/node-canvas),
which requires [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) proficiency and a solid dose
of trigonometry in order to do anything interesting.

_Ten years ago, I would open Excel, make a chart, and press 'Save'._

## Precision and Control

There's a beauty to removing abstraction, to low-maintenance [fixies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-gear_bicycle)
and the resurgence of the [straight razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_razor).

But is it useful to remove abstraction when it exposes a much larger surface
of unrelated complexity? If an artist has an idea of a beautiful visualization,
should they spend a year learning JavaScript? And is that startup cost reasonable,
like the time invested in learning the way paint mixes?

<iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/5047563?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="640" height="352" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe> <p><a href="http://vimeo.com/5047563">ART && CODE Symposium: Hackety Hack, why the lucky stiff</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/sfci">STUDIO for Creative Inquiry</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

[_why](http://vimeo.com/5047563), his presentation at art && code, referred
to the 'learn web programming' chorus as unreasonable - for people just
starting to understand programming, must they learn three inter-connected
languages at once?

Is it even reasonable or useful to recommend people learn a computer language to
complete basic tasks like drawing a picture or running a calculation? While
we have [better resources than ever before](http://www.codecademy.com/) to learn programming,
it's far from something that you can learn [learn in a day, or even a month](http://norvig.com/21-days.html),
and why.

How much of the task of programming is creative, versus bowing to the
whim of a compiler or interpreter and learning 'other tools you need'?

## The Unhappy Simplicity of Choices

There are different kinds of easy - it's
something that I've discussed in the past and even [taken a different opinion on](http://macwright.org/presentations/carto/#11).

There's the easy of choosing the right thing: this is the land of presets,
of 'builders' that are just glorified [wizard patterns](http://ui-patterns.com/patterns/Wizard),
with the same baked in assumption: 'a single goal'.

This is what you can see in tools like [Highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com/products/highcharts),
that attempt to build 'all possible variations' and invite you to choose one.

Anyone can guess the ending - 'reasonable defaults' and opinionated software
is only cool if [agree on reasonable](https://twitter.com/tmcw/status/257602386405777408)
and never want more than you're given.

![Charts](http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3722/9533924560_f504e86159_h.jpg)

d3 takes a different approach: it's a visualization library that grapples
with the fact that _visualizations have very little in common with each other_,
so its atoms, the lowest-level 'things' you can do, are very low-level.
At the most basic level, you're drawing lines, polygons, text, and primitives.
Abstractions above these things, like axes and charts, can be broken down,
decomposed as necessary.

## Interface Atoms

<iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/66085662?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe> <p><a href="http://vimeo.com/66085662">Drawing Dynamic Visualizations</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/worrydream">Bret Victor</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

The demo in this video is interesting because it's so fundamental.

A simpler, easier thing to implement would have a person dragging data onscreen,
the software automatically chooses 20 chart types that seem right, and then
present a limited set of options. Not only would this be much easier to do,
but it would result in fewer clicks, a shorter learning curve, and an easier
thing to sell.

But that would be doing it wrong - that would result in the same contained,
handicapped experimentation as we've had in years of bad wizard user interfaces.
Instead, the basic units of this demo are on the level of d3 - they are unopinioned
visual elements that can be composed into a much larger and more diverse set of outcomes.

## Rewriting

I've started on minor work that pushes in this direction - that tries to
make 'user interface' elements behave like code and to enable 'users' to
think more like coders, the way they already think when writing Excel macros
or meal recipes.

And it's hard. Libraries like [jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/) have faded in importance and attention
and in their place we have tools like [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
that embrace 'content as king' and punt on user interaction beyond
clicking buttons.

But it's important, if only to experiment with a problem
difficult enough that most ignore it.
