Well, time has passed extremely quickly, and it's another month.

I wrote & published 4 things in a row for [MapBox](http://mapbox.com/). The most interesting
was the introduction of the [MapBox Javascript API](http://mapbox.com/blog/mapbox-javascript-api/),
something that I worked a few weeks with [Ansis](https://github.com/ansis) to unify
but the underlying projects have been more than a year's work. What we did
recently is packing - writing [extensive documentation](http://mapbox.com/developers/mapbox.js/),
writing tons of tests (with my favorite [boring old school test framework](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/)),
and dealing with packaging. They're all hard, picky work, and acquired tastes -
but it's really satisfying to make previously technical things accessible.

## Consumption

I loved [Dr. Dobb's interview with Alan Kay](http://ds.io/QZUGJX).

> Extracting patterns from today's programming practices ennobles them in a way they don't deserve

And

> **Binstock:** You seem fastidious about always giving people credit for their work.

> **Kay:** Well, I'm an old-fashioned guy. And I also happen to believe in history.
  The lack of interest, the disdain for history is what makes computing not-quite-a-field.

It's the perfect counterpoint to [an interview with Stephen Wolfram](http://ds.io/QZUB94),
a [less modest](http://ds.io/QZUyKG), [and historically aware](http://ds.io/NQU85U) individual.

Reading has been sporadic, but [Foxfire](http://www.foxfire.org/) is soothing my mind
with its reassurance that people can be good and miles more comfortable with aging than
I am.

After being [kind of unimpressed](http://macwright.org/2012/02/09/recently.html) with
Schneier's Liars & Outliers, I got [Applied Cryptography](http://www.schneier.com/book-applied.html),
which will be a more challenging read, but closer to the center of his expertise.

I've also been reading [v8](http://code.google.com/p/v8/), the Javascript engine, to better
understand it and have rational arguments about Javascript performance. Understanding compilers
is a geeky passion, but treating
them as immovable objects is much worse.

On [Tristen's](http://tristen.ca/) recommendation, I've been listening to a lot of
[Colin McPhee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_McPhee), via a skating video
been listening to [Funky Notes](http://soundcloud.com/funkynotes/), and getting back into
[Swan Lake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beast_Moans).

I'm making a very small move to a different room of my house, and using it as an
opportunity to refactor some posessions and such.

There's much more to come here - a lot of projects are waiting on the final tap to
make them worthwhile to talk about - [more about statistics](https://github.com/tmcw/stream-statistics),
[a bizarre way of doing testing](https://github.com/tmcw/potter-test),
[playing any canvas element](https://github.com/tmcw/playcanvas). I've also got
an expansive post on [clustering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) [algorithms](http://vis4.net/blog/posts/clean-your-symbol-maps/)
and [a library I've been writing about them](https://github.com/mapbox/clustr).
I'm also researching uncompressed image formats and have a few [unfinished iPhone apps](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tmcw/7283120046/in/photostream/)
that are kind of cool.
