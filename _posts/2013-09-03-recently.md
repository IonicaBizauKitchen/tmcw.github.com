[geojson.io](http://geojson.io/) grew into a new stage of maturity. I
[tinkered with new interfaces](http://macwright.org/d3-curvy/) and [algorithms
for feature extraction](http://www.mapbox.com/blog/user-friendly-guided-feature-extraction/),
camped and [ran](http://www.strava.com/activities/77941475) in Virginia
with Kevin, and worked on quite a few fun projects at work.

### Reading

* [Doing with Images Makes Symbols](http://archive.org/details/AlanKeyD1987) by Alan Kay via [rsms](http://rsms.me/)
* [Forced Exposure](http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20130818120421175)
* [People Simply Empty Out](http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/10/people-simply-empty-out.html)
* [Seamus Heaney](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seamus_Heaney) passed, so a poem like
  [Postscript](http://www.smith.edu/poetrycenter/poets/postscript.html) is required
  reading.
* [Pale Fire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Fire)

### Listening

Recently it's all rap, centering around [Odd Future](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odd_Future)
and Tyler The Creator's [pretty incredible trilogy](http://noisey.vice.com/blog/the-conspiracy-theorists-guide-to-tyler-the-creators-wolf-trilogy).

## Turtle

[turtle](http://macwright.org/turtle/v1/#6405522) was written in an hour or
so after watching yet another Alan Kay video. Like [mistakes.io](http://mistakes.io/)
and [geojson.io](http://geojson.io/) it uses [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/) as
a backend storage mechanism.

The formula is simple: you provide a function that takes an argument 't',
for the step (0 to 30000), and it returns a direction, in degrees, or an array
of functions that return either a degree direction or other functions. In
a way, it's a bit like [tail recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call).

It hits a similar need as [Turtle graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics), but
I wanted to simplify one of the surfaces: drawings are coded functionally,
as one number value to another and first-class functions can be used for
branching, recursion, and so on.
