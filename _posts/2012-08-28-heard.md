heard is a native Mac application that sits in your menu bar and records
what you listen to in iTunes.

_It's the small part of last.fm that I want._ It records when you start a song,
how long the song is, the artist, et. cetera. It's anti-social, has nothing
to do with the cloud, and the use case is less precise than 'social sharing and discovery':
the main end-product is the ability to
export your songs to [JSON](http://www.json.org/).

## The Glory Days Of Audioscrobbler + last.fm, Tinfoil Hats

I was an eager user of Audioscrobber, which became [last.fm](http://last.fm/), until it was
[acquired by CBS music group](http://blog.last.fm/2007/05/30/lastfm-acquired-by-cbs)
and then the [founders left](http://blog.last.fm/2009/06/10/message-from-the-lastfm-founders-felix-rj-and-martin)
and then there was [all kinds of drama](http://techcrunch.com/2009/05/22/deny-this-lastfm/)
about them _possibly_ [forking over data to the RIAA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last.fm#CBS_Acquisition_and_redesign_.282007.E2.80.932009.29).
The tinfoil-hat wearing users with iTunes libraries not entirely purchased
from the iTunes Music 'Store' understandably ran away.
That and the new features they tried to implement, like [streaming and subscriptions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last.fm#Changes_to_streaming_and_access_on_other_platforms_.282009.E2.80.932011.29)
seemed like a money-making proposition for the [Pandora](http://www.pandora.com/)-listening
audience rather than a feature for data-hoarding programmer-types
like [myself](http://macwright.org/about/).

But, to their credit, [Audioscrobber.app was released as open source](https://github.com/mxcl/Audioscrobbler.app)
(and provided the 'aha' moment for how to get heard to work). Plus,
[Lastgraph](http://lastgraph3.aeracode.org/) introduced the world to the streamgraph,
later [made accessible by d3js](http://mbostock.github.com/d3/ex/stream.html).

## Oh My God I Am Terrible

This app took a really long time to write. An embarrassing amount of time.

I'd really recommend writing Mac apps, even though (possibly _because_)
the experience invokes unending puzzlement and rage. It's
not as wild as writing in [lisp](http://paulgraham.com/lisp.html)
or [Factor](http://factorcode.org/), but it's practical, mind-bendy,
infuriating, and guaranteed to take you out of your comfort zone.

Initially heard wrote CSV files, like [minute does](http://macwright.org/2012/02/15/minute.html).
But then switched to [Core Data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_Data).
It started without any libraries, and eventually acquired
[Underscore.m](http://underscorem.org/), with the attendant [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/)
dependency. [Minute](http://macwright.org/2012/02/15/minute.html) was written
before [Automatic Reference Counting](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.html),
so I had to relearn properties and memory management. Something
as simple as opening an About window took hours of trial to find
the three-line implementation that works.

## Visualization

Like minute, heard is open-ended: it produces simple data that can be easily
charted with [d3js](http://d3js.org/), [raphael](http://raphaeljs.com/),
or whatever you have handy.

A few examples of graphics would be the [treegraph I made for my recent 'Recently' post](http://macwright.org/2012/09/20/recently.html):

## Champagne for My Real Friends

There are a few turning-point aha moments.

* [Justin](http://mapbox.com/about/team/#justin-miller) helped out tremendously
  with my dumb questions.
* [Cocoa with Love](http://cocoawithlove.com/2010/05/finding-or-creating-application-support.html) explained
  the whole 'application support' folder thing.

## Get It

This is open-source software, and it's free. It isn't 'signed', so you'll need
to [turn Gatekeeper off](http://its.uiowa.edu/apps2/support/article/4038) if
you're using Mountain Lion.

It almost certainly has bugs and could use lots of refinement. Head to the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/tmcw/heard/issues) if you've got something
to report, and file a pull request if you've got something to contribute.
