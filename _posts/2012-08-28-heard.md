heard is [last.fm](http://last.fm/) without the last or the fm. It listens
to what you're listening to in iTunes and writes it down for posterity.

I was an eager user of last.fm until it was [acquired by CBS music group](http://blog.last.fm/2007/05/30/lastfm-acquired-by-cbs)
and then the [founders left](http://blog.last.fm/2009/06/10/message-from-the-lastfm-founders-felix-rj-and-martin)
and then there was [all kinds of drama](http://techcrunch.com/2009/05/22/deny-this-lastfm/)
about them [forking over data to the RIAA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last.fm#CBS_Acquisition_and_redesign_.282007.E2.80.932009.29).
The tinfoil-hat wearing users with iTunes libraries not entirely purchased
from the iTunes Music 'Store' understandably ran for cover.
That and the new features they tried to implement, like [streaming and subscriptions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last.fm#Changes_to_streaming_and_access_on_other_platforms_.282009.E2.80.932011.29)
seemed like a money-making proposition for the wishy-washy [Pandora](http://www.pandora.com/)
audience rather than a feature for the data-hoarding programmer-types
like [myself](http://macwright.org/about/).

But back in the day, everything was cool, and there were
[neat open source apps](https://github.com/mxcl/Audioscrobbler.app) that
logged your plays and [classic infographics that showed them off](http://lastgraph3.aeracode.org/).

_So heard is just the part that I want._ It sits in your menu bar as a native
OSX application and records when you start a song, how long the song is,
the artist, et. cetera. It plays nice with [DropBox](http://www.dropbox.com/)
or any other sort of file storage. It's local - it's anti-social, has nothing
to do with the cloud, and the use case is less precise than just sharing
what you listen to.
