This little experiment... I don't even have a great explanation. But,
at the time it seemed like the obvious thing to do, and it came together
lightning-fast.

In short, it's a very, very large maze - with 64,800 empty spaces. It
is solvable, but I'd imagine it being pretty draining.

It's not super-challenging to build - Maze generation is a hard problem,
so I used an [existing Javascript implementation](http://ds.io/pA5yPH)
from the ever-useful [rosettacode.org](http://ds.io/qKngHS). Since there
aren't good bindings for [OGR](http://ds.io/opGktu) in Javascript, I used
the excellent [Shapely](http://gispython.org/shapely/docs/1.0/manual.html)
project again, like I did with
[my running map](http://macwright.org/2011/07/28/mapping-runs.html). The
[code for translating](https://github.com/tmcw/demo/blob/gh-pages/maze/generate.py)
[ASCII mazes](https://github.com/tmcw/demo/blob/gh-pages/maze/maze_complex.txt)
into shapefiles is quite simple.

Also like the running map, I'm doing hacky geospatial cheats - this is
translating into [EPSG:4326](http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/4326/)
space, which I then translate to so-called Spherical Mercator. So,
you can see some [Tissot-style distortion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissot's_Indicatrix)
in the final product because of the clash of systems. Here, I think it's
somewhat neat, but in the future I'm going to see how some mercator
math works out, possibly also yielding pixel accuracy.

That said, it's a huge maze. There are more complex games to come, but
I'm honestly not much of a gamer - more a fan of absurdist constructions
like [Progress Quest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progress_Quest).

And, of course, it's rendered by [TileMill](http://tilemill.com) and
the only reason why I can post it on the internet and not worry about
things breaking is because of [TileStream Hosting](http://mapbox.com/#/tilestream)
keeping it online and super-fast. For the map, I'm using old standbys
[Modest Maps](http://github.com/stamen/modestmaps-js) and
[easey](https://github.com/mapbox/easey) (which just got a big deployment
at [our new developmentseed.org](http://developmentseed.org/)).

But for those up to the challenge,
[try it out as a full-screen app](http://macwright.org/demo/maze/). Bonus
points for building a fast maze-solving bot in Canvas / Modest Maps.
