## Consumption

Film: [Death Proof](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1028528/), [Ken Burns Civil War](http://www.pbs.org/civilwar/),
[Drive](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0780504/).

Reading: [On the Meaning of Life](http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/01/on-meaning-of-life.html)
by [H. L. Mencken](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._L._Mencken),
[Lasting Value](http://www.marco.org/2012/05/03/lasting-value) by [Marco Arment](http://www.marco.org/),
[many of Steve Klabnik's posts](http://blog.steveklabnik.com/archive), [Peter Thiel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel)'s
[CS183 Class 4 notes](http://blakemasters.tumblr.com/post/21169325300/peter-thiels-cs183-startup-class-4-notes-essay).

Listening: [Harry Belafonte](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Belafonte),
[CocoRosie's La maison de mon rÃªve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_maison_de_mon_r%C3%AAve), and
[J Dilla's The Shining](http://ds.io/IN0XV3).

## Archival Software

[Aaron Straup Cope's](http://www.aaronland.info/weblog/) work on archival software
like [parallel-flickr](http://straup.github.com/parallel-flickr/) has been
pretty fascinating.

I've been working on a [clone of Tom Insam's instabackup called permagram](https://github.com/tmcw/instabackup)
that provides a HTML/JS frontend and looks rather nice, if bare. Every
once in a while, I run the `python instabackup.py`, it does its thing,
and the photos are there.

There could be a sweet spot of the simple, archival style in so-called
data portals. Instead of complex software, could they be just [S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/),
a static web frontend, [JSON](http://json.org/)
representation of metadata, and [javascript to search and facet](http://square.github.com/crossfilter/)
on the fly? The cost could become low enough that it keeps going after
town governments cut funding.

## Learning and Teaching

I led a weekend session teaching Javascript at the [MapBox](http://mapbox.com/) office,
resulting in [a GitHub repository and wiki called 'sweetcodejam', that has code,
reference materials, and toys for learning](https://github.com/tmcw/sweetcodejam/wiki).

In the same vein, I'm working on a post for this site that'll summarize map clients
as a type, and some algorithm implementations to simplify other areas of understanding.

I finished the [Frederick Run Fest](http://www.frederickrunfest.com/) half-marathon
in 1:49:45.09, a time I'm pretty happy about. Above is the actual course
diagram, and once you see the dragon, you can't unsee it.

The number of people running with iPhones was unexpected, though the front-pack
had more simple watches and [dorkwatches like mine](https://buy.garmin.com/shop/shop.do?pID=349&ra=true).
