Time has passed since the the [last post about anything but maps, math, statistics](/2012/02/09/recently.html),
and so on. A lot has happened in the meantime - work at
[MapBox](http://mapbox.com/) has reached a peak of intensity and
stayed there, with our launch of [maps on Foursquare](http://foursquare.com/)
leading to a continuing hockey-stick graph of traffic growth.

I've been working quite a bit. That's my [taskwarrior](http://taskwarrior.org/) history -
tasks are added at the top of lines and finished at the bottom.
They've been adding up.
Or at least it was my fault to add things like
"build a guitar amp from scratch", and "listen to all my unplayed music", with 2,073 songs to go,
leading to a few month-old tasks. Eventually a sort of vacation-via-productivity-guilt
should occur.

DC has decided to rebuild itself again, retooling most structures into condos.
My walk to work includes a vista of nine cranes at a time, so they've integrated
themselves into my consciousness in such a way that all-too-deep thoughts
center on crane affairs.

I read [Leaving the Atocha Station](http://www.amazon.com/Leaving-Atocha-Station-Ben-Lerner/dp/1566892740),
watched [THX 1138](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/THX_1138) and
[Battle Royale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_Royale_(film),
and listened to [Blonde Redhead](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blonde_Redhead),
[Islands](http://islandsareforever.com/),
and [Way Yes](http://wayyes.com/).

[I presented](http://dhcole.github.com/whereconf/#0) at
[Where 2.0](http://whereconf.com/) (now renamed _just Where_), with
[Dave Cole](http://mapbox.com/team/dave-cole/) from [MapBox](http://mapbox.com/).
Next week is [FOSS4G-NA](http://foss4g-na.org), which will feature a
[significantly more wild presentation](http://foss4g-na.org/schedule/new-maps-beyond-the-google-maps-paradigm/).

_Where_ was in San Francisco, which made it infinitely better than previous
versions in San Jose, even if the [Groupon](http://www.groupon.com/) wave
startups had mostly burned out and the resulting crowd was an odd combination
of traditional 'social media' and a few hard-art visualization folks.

[![](/graphics/ventricle.png)](http://macwright.org/demo/ventricle/)

While I was there, I wrote a quick demo of a running map called
[Ventricle, which you should check out.](http://macwright.org/demo/ventricle/)
It's a variation on the concept for my [previous running map](http://macwright.org/running/),
which aims for extreme literality: circles pulse at the precise
bpm recorded by my [dorky heart rate monitor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garmin_Forerunner).

It required some fooling around with `Math.sin()` math since it uses a singular draw loop
([see the source](https://github.com/tmcw/demo/blob/gh-pages/ventricle/index.html)),
but I think it's accurate.

If you have a similar [geeky watch](http://www.garmin.com/products/forerunner305/) and a new
enough browser [to support FileReader](http://caniuse.com/#feat=filereader), you
can drag & drop a `.gpx` file on the map, and the map will locate and
show your run.
