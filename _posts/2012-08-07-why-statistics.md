<div style='text-align:center;line-height:200px;font-style:italic;width:638px;height:200px;border:1px solid #000;'>it's hard to show the void with a picture</div>

Because _visualization is bad at some things_. Most of all, it's bad at
_[saying no](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_hypothesis)_.
We're great at pattern recognition and correlation:
that's what makes the [geospatial sector](http://mapbox.com/) so hot. Everything
has latitude and longitude, so geodata is inherently compatible. But sometimes
there's nothing. Hard research often ends up validating the null hypthesis or
finding inconclusive evidence - how often does a pretty visualization do
the same? If the goal is to [understand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis),
it should include understanding the void.

Because _hard algorithms are unsexy, difficult, and rewarding_. Few
people want to implement them so the implementations have a much longer
half-life than your typical jQuery plugin, and a much greater effect in
what they enable.

Because _statistics is poorly taught and poorly explained_. Math jargon is taken
as a matter of course, with only
[alternatives at the edges of thought](http://worrydream.com/KillMath/).
Computational statistics has grown its [own world](http://www.r-project.org/)
that makes it less accessible to other areas of computation.
People think the problem with this is that fewer _producers_ will use statistics
to do their analysis: but the real problem is that lack of statistical
literacy makes it harder for _consumers_ to understand what they're seeing.
We talk about [how to lie with statistics](http://ds.io/MrU2Vo)
but not how to detect lies, re-run calculations, or articulate problems in
analysis.
