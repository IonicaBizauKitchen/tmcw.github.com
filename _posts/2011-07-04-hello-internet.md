Well, it's halfway through 2011, and I feel like making some stuff and talking about it. And thus I'm yanking my internet presence away from my [tumblr-powered blog](http://notes.tommacwright.com) and using [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [GitHub](http://github.com) to build something a little more homey, customized, and, more importantly, open source.

This blog will be about stuff that I make, and then intermittently about stuff that I consume - I hope for the former to be weekly and the latter to be a monthly roundup.
