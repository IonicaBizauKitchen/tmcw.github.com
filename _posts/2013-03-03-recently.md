February was a busy month. My mind was split between [new projects](http://macwright.org/2013/02/05/mistakes.html),
[dc](http://macwright.org/2013/02/20/you-cannot-have-the-code.html),
[refueling a big project](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox.js), and
[working on a big one](https://github.com/systemed/iD).

## Listening

* [Buke and Gase - General Dome](http://pitchfork.com/news/49750-watch-buke-and-gases-eerie-general-dome-video/) -
  'Hard Times' was the song of the month.
* [Atoms for Peace - AMOK](http://atomsforpeace.info/) - Thom Yorke hijinks
  and Flea minus RHCP. Quality album.
* [Yo La Tengo - Fade](http://www.yolatengo.com/) - plus seeing them in-concert
  at the [9:30 Club](http://www.930.com/)
* [Thao & The Get Down Stay Down - We the Common](http://thaoandthegetdownstaydown.com/) and
  [Emancipator's Dusk to Dawn](http://www.vibe.com/article/new-music-emancipator-dusk-dawn-full-album-stream) -
  both by fellow [William & Mary](http://www.wm.edu/) grads.

Plus reviewing four tracks to follow-up [Teen Mom's album, Mean Tom](http://analogedition.bigcartel.com/product/teen-mom-i-mean-tom-i-ep-12)

[Away From Keyboard](http://www.tpbafk.tv/) is fantastic. I expected it to be
a bit over the top or poorly produced, but it's really a quality piece of film
and journalism.

## Reading

Quite a bit. I posted about the DC Code's [compilation](http://macwright.org/2013/02/11/the-code-written.html),
[process](http://macwright.org/2013/02/13/the-code-compiled.html), [copyright status](http://macwright.org/2013/02/14/the-law-is-public-domain.html),
[propriety](http://macwright.org/2013/02/20/you-cannot-have-the-code.html),
and [access](http://macwright.org/2013/02/22/access-ownership.html), so there's
been a lot to learn.

A few highlights:

* [Tear Down this (Pay)Wall](http://blog.law.cornell.edu/voxpop/2011/07/15/tear-down-this-paywall/)
* [Clickwrap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickwrap) and [Browse wrap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browse_wrap) -
  two of the important elements of the problems with the DC Code
* [No Law](http://www.sup.org/book.cgi?id=4495) - a great text about copyright law
* [ProCD vs. Zeidenberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ProCD_v._Zeidenberg) - a court case establishing
  the validity of click-wrap and its ability to override copyright
* [Summaries of Fair Use Cases](http://fairuse.stanford.edu/Copyright_and_Fair_Use_Overview/chapter9/9-c.html) -
  since fair use is per-case, this gives good examples of how those cases have gone.
* [A Short Lesson in Perspective](http://www.lindsredding.com/2012/03/11/a-overdue-lesson-in-perspective/) -
  depressing and valid
* [Google Invades](http://www.lrb.co.uk/v35/n03/rebecca-solnit/diary)
* [Peter Thiel's Infantile Culture](http://joeblu.net/post/1330454926/peter-thiels-infantile-culture)
* [Fix the Law to Fix America](http://www.americanthinker.com/2013/02/fix_the_law_to_fix_america.html)
