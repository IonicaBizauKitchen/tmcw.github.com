Colorado is amazing. Thanks to good friends Mike & Jenny
for hosting me during this fantastic weekend and little bits of time during
my grueling conference schedule. It's been fantastic.

For now, heading off to Boulder till
Wednesday. I'm going to try to stay unplugged for most of that too, just
taking a bit of time to prepare a presentation.

More when I get back to civilization, but I must say: mountains. Lots of
photos from my [photoset on Flickr](http://ds.io/rdbLLE).
