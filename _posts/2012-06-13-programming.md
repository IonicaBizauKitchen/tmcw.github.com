> programming is rather thankless. u see your works become replaced by
  superior ones in a year. unable to run at all in a few
  more. - [_why the lucky stiff](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff)

The process of writing software deludes us into thinking that the
implementation matters as an end in itself, and that authorship matters.

Software does last forever, but it's less like building a dream and more
like building a car, which will eventually need a replacement transmission
that they don't make anymore, or more likely the roads are upgraded to
monorails and it's cheaper to build something new.

Maintenance is a wise choice for any software or car owner depending on
metaphor direction, but friction always wins and technology advances
by rewriting the wheel.

It's okay: it would be simpler if open source software followed an
early Microsoft naming convention. [node](http://nodejs.org/) being
'node 2010' and so any passerby would know to upgrade from PHP 95
and to switch again to what comes out in 2013 when it does.

If you want to help, write software that explains itself,
and then explain it again, and then explain the concept.
Anticipate antiquity and warmly greet the eager
people who will write what's next.
