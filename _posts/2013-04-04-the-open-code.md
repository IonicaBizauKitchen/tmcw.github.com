**tl;dr: thanks to good people, we now have an unencumbered digital copy of dc's laws.
let's [meet april 14th in washington, dc to realize the massive potential of this](http://dccode-eorg.eventbrite.com/)**

I couldn't be happier to write that the project to bring DC's laws into
the digital eras and put them in everyone's hands made a big breakthrough:
today you can [download an unofficial copy of the
Code (current through December 11, 2012) from the DC Council's website](http://dccouncil.us/UnofficialDCCode).
Not only that, but the licensing for this copy is officially [CC0](http://creativecommons.org/choose/zero/),
a [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/) license that aims to be
a globally-effective [Public Domain](http://macwright.org/2013/02/14/the-law-is-public-domain.html)
designation.

A lot of people made this possible: [Ben Bryant](http://dccouncil.us/offices/office-of-the-general-counsel)
was extremely understanding through more than 50 emails over more than
four months, [Carl Malamud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Malamud) made the
brilliant move of [digitizing and distributing the code](http://boingboing.net/2013/03/27/municipal-codes-of-dc-free-fo.html),
declaring DC's copyright invalid. [Josh Tauberer](http://occams.info/) made
the vital contact with [V David Zvenyach](https://twitter.com/vdavez), who
together cleaned files delivered by [WestLaw](http://www.westlaw.com/) [in accordance to
H.11.1 of the contract](http://archive.org/details/DcContractWithWestFor2012).
And many journalists took the time to understand the issue, speak clearly,
and make this a reality.

A massive thanks to everyone involved.

There are a few things that this isn't: it isn't the official copy of the
code, and lawyers would be ill-advised to cite it alone. It isn't up-to-date -
the council [is fast-moving](http://macwright.org/2013/02/11/the-code-written.html) and
this is just a snapshot. In time we'll fix these problems too.

And so the floodgates are open - now that we have the raw data, so many applications
of this information are possible.

What else is there to build? A great smartphone interface. Topic-specific
bookmarks. Text analysis. Great, instant search. Mirrored archives to everywhere.
Printable copies for DIY and for print-on-demand services. And lots more.

We're not waiting till then to start though: [dc-decoded](https://github.com/openlawdc/dc-decoded) is a
project I started today to finish the long-awaited task of bringing DC's laws
into [The State Decoded](http://www.statedecoded.com/). The [openlawdc organization on GitHub](https://github.com/openlawdc)
is dedicated to working on these problems, and it's **open**:
[you can and should get access if you want to contribute](https://github.com/openlawdc/openlawdc.github.com/issues/1).
