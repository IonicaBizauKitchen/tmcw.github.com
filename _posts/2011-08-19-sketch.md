**Sketch lets you draw on maps and have fun doing it.** It's based on [Polymaps](http://polymaps.org), and has a bunch of
superpowers like touch compatibility, streaming changes, different inks,
text mode, and lots else that's in the code but not in this thrown-together
demo on top of [World Glass](http://mapbox.com/#/tileset/world-glass).

This is something of a [MapBox](http://mapbox.com) leak: sketch is a component
we're using in a big project that goes way farther. This is the tip of the
iceberg - the fully-open-source, in the public tip.

Sketch speaks [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/) fluently and exclusively, so
you can hook up your drawings to your favorite serious map-authoring kit,
like [TileMill](http://tilemill.com/pages/index.html). It draws with
[SVG](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/painting.html), and is super simple to
add to Polymaps, just `map.add(sketch())`.

Oh, and since this is kind of crazy stuff, it doesn't work with IE. Sorry!
