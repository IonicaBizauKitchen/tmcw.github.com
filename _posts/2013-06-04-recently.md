[Teen Mom](http://teenmomdc.com/) played our first show in months, at the
[Rock and Roll Hotel](http://www.rockandrollhoteldc.com/) in DC.
I'm yielding bass guitar duties to the much-more-experienced Omar, and taking
up guitar again. So far I've avoided collecting more than one guitar
and one amp for this task, but we'll see how that lasts.

[Brett](https://soundcloud.com/brettdc) did a great remix of our track
_I Wanna Go Out_.

I [talked TileMill](https://speakerdeck.com/tmcw/tilemill) at [OpenVisConf](http://openvisconf.com/),
[iD](http://macwright.org/presentations/id-foss4g/) and [Carto](http://macwright.org/presentations/carto-foss4g/)
and [OpenStreetMap](http://macwright.org/presentations/osm-intro/) at
[FOSS4G NA](http://foss4g-na.org/). My [big index of presentations is growing](http://macwright.org/presentations/)
but luckily so is the percentage of reusable slides. Used
[pig](http://macwright.org/pig/#0) for these presentations (except for TileMill at OpenVisConf)
and felt pretty okay with it.

Been sketching a bit, and posting sketches to [my new Instagram account](http://instagram.com/ooooooooooooohh).

Also working on a few visualizations for an upcoming web publication.

## Also

This month [Father Lasch](http://fatherlasch.com/), whose site I built a [long,
long time ago](http://fatherlasch.com/about/46/article-archive) and somehow still
runs, and who was a great leader at my middle school, [got in The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/21/us/catholic-church-whistle-blowers-join-forces-on-abuse.html?hp&_r=0)
for being a leading force for transparency and accountability in the local
Catholic Church. Hats off to him.

The [National Day of Civic Hacking](http://hackforchange.org/) conflicted with
the aforementioned concert with [Snowden](http://www.snowden.info/), and thus
I wasn't able to attend. But, open source worked this time around - [Lou Huang](https://github.com/louh),
[Eric Mill](https://github.com/konklone), and [Keith Ivey](https://github.com/kcivey)
all made awesome improvements to the projects.
