I went to Portland for [State of the Map US](http://stateofthemap.us/) and
gave [this presentation about OSM architecture](http://macwright.org/presentations/sotmus/).
It was fairly well-received but the topic was too broad to have enough concreteness.

At Portland, we also announced and discussed the [Knight News Grant](http://mapbox.com/blog/kicking-off-knight-work/)
that's funding some OSM work. And so I've been pushing into that -
just [posted the first bit of information about the iD project](http://mapbox.com/osmdev/2012/10/25/diving-into-id/),
an editor started by [Richard Fairhurst](http://www.systemed.net/)
that I'm working on completing.

The [action is happening in Richard's git repo](https://github.com/systemed/iD),
and [I'm also maintaining a demo instance](http://macwright.org/iD/) for playing
around (it's far from complete). It's exciting to be able to work on this project
from the relative beginning, since we can learn the lessons of all past editors
and think about making it fast & usable on every technical level.

It's also being built with [d3js](http://d3js.org/), and so I've been working
on making some of the simple parts, like [a tiling engine](http://bl.ocks.org/3943330)
and [drawing functionality](http://bl.ocks.org/3960059) simple and usable.

## Reading

* [Why We Can't Solve Big Problems](http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/429690/why-we-cant-solve-big-problems/)
  is a lot of simple and well-deserved startup creativity-bashing, but also
  a pretty good contrast with the recent past.
* [Travis Shrugged](http://pandodaily.com/2012/10/24/travis-shrugged/),
  also on the topic of 'startups' is a pretty convincing 'connect the dots'
  as far as the objectivist/libertarian side of tech.
* [Feist vs. Rural](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feist_v._Rural) is one of
  the more interesting and lawsuits to read about on Wikipedia, with a strong
  ruling on current copyright disputes.

I've updated my [module pattern post](http://macwright.org/2012/06/04/the-module-pattern.html)
with more information about memory size - it turns out that the module pattern
increases memory consumption when you have many instances with their own
function closures.

[Happen](https://github.com/tmcw/happen) and [simple-statistics](https://github.com/tmcw/simple-statistics)
are now available through [component](https://github.com/component/component),
if that's how you roll.

## Listening

[Chris Isaak's 'Wicked Game'](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAOxCqSxRD0) has
been on constant rotation. So has the [Happiness Project](http://www.happiness-project.ca/)
by [Charles Spearin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Spearin).

I'm more or less gearing up for [hmtpng](http://www.hmtpng.com/) next month,
in which I'll attempt to write & record an album in a month (or, more likely
a half-month depending on schedule). Need to dust off the instruments,
and dusty instrumental training.
