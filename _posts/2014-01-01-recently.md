The latter bits of this year didn't see me posting much here. Amongst other
things, that'll change in 2014. Anyway.

## Year

This year I spoke less at conferences. It made me uneasy that my presence would
reduce diversity, and writing seems like a higher-throughput channel for talking tech.
Plus, I've never learned in a lecture setting, so giving lectures felt odd.

It was another year in DC. MapBox's [San Francisco office](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/office-space-in-san-francisco/)
is now more than the few chairs at [Code for America](http://codeforamerica.org/)
so I'll probably be spending more time out there in the coming year. But
DC is still the center of gravity for my life, despite my gripes with the city-as-such.

This was my third year working full-time at MapBox (after two & a bit at [Development Seed](http://developmentseed.org/)).
DS has a [new beginning](http://developmentseed.org/blog/2013/12/10/ian-schuler-to-lead-development-seed/) and
MapBox has [funding](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/10million-funding-foundry-group/) and
[tons of geniuses](https://www.mapbox.com/about/team/). I didn't expect to
'do maps' and still don't have any love for GIS and such, but the more I learn,
the more everything is connected.

I didn't record enough solo music this year. Teen Mom released Gilly, our
second album, and our friend Omar joined, and sadly, left, the band. We're scouting
out cabins or mountaintops to record a full-length album.

I ran 336 miles this year, and I want to run a lot more last year. A marathon
is probably too much, but another half-marathon would be good motivation. It's
awesome that MapBox has dialed up the running culture and has a handful of
accomplished marathoners now.
