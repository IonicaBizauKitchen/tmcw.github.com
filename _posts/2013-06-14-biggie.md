[Biggie is a tool for making presentations](http://macwright.org/biggie/) that
makes it easy to make [presentations with big](http://macwright.org/big/), and
publish with one click. Unlike Big, Biggie does the trick of turning
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) into
slides, provided you separate slides with `---`, the 'hr' shorthand.

I want to make Big accessible to everyone.

## Style

It's easy to switch [big-themes](https://github.com/tmcw/big-themes) -
there's a dropdown, and automatic preview. The
themes up there are a little ugly - [zero is zero](https://github.com/tmcw/biggie/blob/gh-pages/js/style/zero.hbs) -
but it's easy to contribute one!

## Publish

The coolest part is that you can publish with one click, which is just standing on the
shoulders of giants - it posts a [Gist](https://gist.github.com/) to [GitHub](https://github.com/)
and links you to its page on [Mike Bostock](http://bost.ocks.org/)'s [bl.ocks.org](http://bl.ocks.org/).

## Tech

The tech is basic; [CodeMirror](http://codemirror.net/) (browserified thanks to [Max Ogden](http://maxogden.com/)!),
[browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify), [hbsfy](https://github.com/epeli/node-hbsfy) for
templating, [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked) for Markdown parsing.

This was generally [written from 12-1:30am last night](https://github.com/tmcw/biggie/graphs/punch-card)
so is still rough around a few edges - which [you can help with!](https://github.com/tmcw/biggie)
