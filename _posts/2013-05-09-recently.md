## Consumption

* [The Macintosh Project Selected Papers](http://archive.org/details/bitsavers_applemacThlectedPapersFeb80_5957467) - this was the best read this month.
  The dialog between Jobs, Woz, and Raskin is incredible, and their ideas -
  whether it's more important to be cheap or powerful, how to de-nerd computing,
  even _how the value of computers relates to their place on the network_.

> We don't think of the telephone company primarily as a manufacturer of the
  little $40 things with dials or pushbuttons that we have in our homes and
  on our desks. The implications of this proposal, at one extreme, is that
  Apple will be seen, in the future, not so much as a builder of hardware,
  but as a purveyor of a service that interpenetrates the telephone network,
  and provides information.

## Elsewhere

I gave [the first presentation about the DC Code project](http://macwright.org/presentations/dccode/#0) at
[Transparency Camp](http://transparencycamp.org/), to a room of people way
more knowledgeable about legislation and open data than myself. In a session
at the 'unconference', I wrote [dccode.org/simple](http://dccode.org/simple/),
a no-css, no-javascript version of the code, which is another experiment
in accessibility and simplicity. It's [generated by a tiny node.js script](https://github.com/openlawdc/simple/blob/gh-pages/generate.js)

We [re-released mapbox.js based on Leaflet](http://mapbox.com/blog/mapbox-js-with-leaflet/),
[redesign the MapBox tour](http://mapbox.com/tour/), and pulled together some
important architectural changes that'll make it easier to move faster.

[iD is now the default editor on OpenStreetMap](http://mapbox.com/blog/new-map-editor-launches-openstreetmap/)
and it's working pretty well. Lots of challenges left, and some of the more
'fun' performance optimizations are ahead of us. We [blogged its development on /osmdev](http://mapbox.com/osmdev/).

I wrote [lodebuilder](http://macwright.org/lodebuilder/), an online tool
to make a particular kind of loading background that I first used in iD
and seems to be quite applicable elsewhere. ([name inspiration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lode_Runner_2))

I immediately used it for my [mistakes.io](http://mistakes.io/) project,
which added the ability to save anonymous [Gists](https://gist.github.com/)
with Cmd-S.

I polished up and gave a domain name to one of my simplest and most straightforward
projects, now [called debugbrowser.com. It simply documents opening developer extensions in all browsers](http://debugbrowser.com/).
