It's [whyday!](http://whyday.org/). If you aren't familiar with _why,
'why the lucky stiff' was an inspirational coder/musician/artist/poet who
created [incredible amounts of cool stuff](http://viewsourcecode.org/why/)
and then [disappeared](http://www.rubyinside.com/why-the-lucky-stiff-is-missing-2278.html) precisely two years ago.

So, enough standing around.

Here's the first thing: [Heckle](https://github.com/tmcw/heckle): a **nodejs project site generator**, inspired by [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

It makes websites for [node](http://nodejs.org/) projects, based off of the `package.json`
that node developers already have lying around for [npm](http://npmjs.org/)
and that very very informative `README.md` that you should have around.

<div class='link-block'>
  <a href='http://macwright.org/heckle'>Heckle's home page is generated with itself →</a>
</div>

That's all! Not much magic, though it does [choose a color from the name of your project](https://github.com/tmcw/heckle/blob/master/color.js#L1), so
each project has a slightly different shade but the shade your project gets will stay the same across rebuilds. It also, I am sure, features many bugs.

You run it by calling `heckle`, and so far it takes no arguments. It'll
take some soon, but it's super-simple, and spits out really simple websites.
On the plus side, it generates static HTML websites that you can just throw
in a directory, on S3, on GitHub or DropBox or however you'd like to host them,
and it does so in a way that hopefully requires minimal (if any) changes
to your actual project.

You can install heckle if you have npm installed by running `npm install -g heckle`, or add it to your `devDependencies` if you'd like to be part of a build process.
