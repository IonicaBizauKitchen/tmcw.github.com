It's been a year since I started [writing](http://macwright.org/2011/07/04/hello-internet.html)
here.

It's been cool - some of this writing has been in
[Javascript Weekly](http://javascriptweekly.com/archive/82.html),
[Runners World](http://othervoices.runnersworld.com/2011/08/the-art-of-the-run/),
[Quantified Self](http://quantifiedself.com/2012/04/numbers-from-around-the-web-round-6/),
and a few other spots. Though, honestly, [gif clock](http://macwright.org/demo/gifclock/) is
the most popular page here.

The proliferation of [technical posts](http://macwright.org/2012/06/04/the-module-pattern.html) wasn't
initially intended; I fear it's too easy to use lingo that I don't know is lingo,
and be less informational than I'd like. I'm planning to write about a few
new topics, like audio and statistical analysis, which are a bit outside of the maps-realm.

After all, there's no deep love of cartography or childhood fascination with maps:
it's just making and understanding things. And hopefully, with my newer thinking,
demystifying concepts and 'making things makeable': stuff like
[map projections](http://macwright.org/2012/03/12/project-it-yourself.html), or
[linear regressions](http://macwright.org/play-statistics/linear_regression/).

The idea that [hackers](http://bit.ly/Lgh1BX) learn by _creating_, not just doing,
means that we to make concepts accessible for them to grow.

In a year: [MapBox has grown](http://mapbox.com/) to have a 4x5 grid on the [team page](http://mapbox.com/team/),
it [got foursquare](http://blog.foursquare.com/2012/02/29/foursquare-is-joining-the-openstreetmap-movement-say-hi-to-pretty-new-maps/)
as the first 'big' user of [MapBox Streets](http://mapbox.com/blog/announcing-mapbox-streets/).
[My band released an album](http://teenmomdc.com/) and has [a vinyl release](http://analogedition.com/)
on the way. Thanks to friends and races, I'll run double or triple the miles I ran last year,
and hopefully [read twice as much as well](http://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/341849).
I switched to a standing desk at home and at work.

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) has been a steady and reliable engine for turning text into
pages, and I've happily limited the site to three redesigns. Turned off [disqus](http://disqus.com/)
comments because of the external dependency and hassle of dealing with spam, and I'm
turning off [swiftype](http://swiftype.com/) for site search - it's an impressive piece of tech, but
rarely used.

Due to those things, I'm still a DC resident, working for [MapBox](http://mapbox.com/). It's
a tech anomaly in the city and in the industry: old, low churn, and experienced in [several](http://managingnews.com/)
[previous](http://openatrium.com/) [lives](http://developmentseed.org/). The thing that
makes a job great is the ability to change what you do there, and I've got that.
