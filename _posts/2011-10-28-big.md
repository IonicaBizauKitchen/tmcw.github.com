[Big](http://github.com/tmcw/big) is a presentation system that I wrote for
doing my own talks. It's a sharply focused tool that's tailored to a minimalist
presentation - which some call the
[Takahashi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takahashi_method) or
[Lessig method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig#Lessig_Method).

It has some special characteristics:

It's very small - **42 lines** of Javascript code, currently.
This is with minimal
[golfing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf) - it's still readable,
because it simply isn't doing all that much. The most art or cleverness
that it's ever required was figuring out that text should start huge and
go smaller until it was small enough - otherwise you'll always have a line
breaking on the last iteration. Lesson learned.

It's embeddable on a single page. The quickstart is

{% highlight sh %}
wget https://raw.github.com/tmcw/big/gh-pages/big.quickstart.html
{% endhighlight %}

It's weirdly attractive. White Helvetica on black, as large as it can go.
The restrictions on styling and complete ignorance of monitor size are
meant to deal with the trials of bad VGA projectors and conference wifi.
Choose your own images, and if they're too bright to be read on white
text, crack open Photoshop and darken them. There's really not much
to it.

It doesn't adapt to large blocks of text. It forces you into a writing
and presentation style.

Oh, and it works embedded in `<iframe>s`: below is a **big** presentation. Click to advance.

Thanks to an unfortunate travel schedule recently, I added
[onhashchange](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.onhashchange)
support so that your back button works, and touch support so it
works on iPhones and iPads. Which means: a tap means advance the slide.
There's no back button yet.

I think it could be cool to keep pushing Big to be cleaner, smaller, and
more usable. Another nice thing is that a slide in HTML looks like
`<div>Hello</div>`. That's it: a `<div>`. You can copy & paste them as
you wish, and it'll work. So despite being a nerd's presentation sytem,
there's no real HTML knowledge required.

Mainly it needs PDF export, which I think can be done with a headless
WebKit, but [wkhtmltopdf](http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/) is
horribly slow to compile, so I haven't experimented with it, or its JavaScript
support. Previously I used [showoff](https://github.com/schacon/showoff)
for presentations - which worked okay, and eventually grew PDF export, but
very buggy PDFs.

Oh, and if you're looking for a less absurd presentation system, by all
means please use the awesome [deck.js](http://imakewebthings.github.com/deck.js/).

So kick the tires. It's [open source](https://github.com/tmcw/big),
public domain.
