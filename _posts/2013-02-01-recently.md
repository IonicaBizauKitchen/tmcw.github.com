> In January 2007 he sincerely believed that when WikiLeaks published commentary on the Somalia assassination order document it would be “very closely collaboratively analysed by hundreds of Wikipedia editors” and by “thousands of refugees from the Somali, Ethiopian and Chinese expat communities”. This simply had not happened.

It was impossible not to feel the impact of Aaron Swartz's suicide this month,
or to read about it. I had to 'read later' everything because the day-of
just felt unexpected and traumatic and really, really important. Read
[Doctorow](http://boingboing.net/2013/01/12/rip-aaron-swartz.html),
[Lessig](http://lessig.tumblr.com/post/40347463044/prosecutor-as-bully),
and [Stamos](http://unhandled.com/2013/01/12/the-truth-about-aaron-swartzs-crime/).

I love that he shows an impressive ability to understand exactly what he doesn't
know, and exactly the right level of technical detail required for each question -
even when he could go to the level of bits.

## Daytrotter

In January, my band, [Teen Mom](http://www.teenmomdc.com/), played [Daytrotter](http://www.daytrotter.com/)
in Rock Island, IL. The five-song session was streamed live to subscribers
and the recorded, mixed version will be available in the coming months. Plus
there'll be a classic Daytrotter-style portrait (drawn by [Johnnie Cluney](http://www.daytrotter.com/#!/content/about.htm)).

I made a thing, a [Bleep labs](http://bleeplabs.com/) [pico paso](http://bleeplabs.com/store/the-pico-paso/).
Bleep's manuals & design seem more clear and readable than some other kits I've hacked on.
My soldering skills are still rudimentary, but this was great practice.

And I acquired a thing, a [bookrest lamp from suck uk](http://www.suck.uk.com/products/bookrestlamp).
It's a nice little addition to my little room, and a great light for reading and working.

## Thinking about Complexity

[![songs, exported from heard](http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8356/8413737349_60a4ddd5b9_b.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tmcw/8413737349/in/photostream)

I've been thinking a lot about complexity, simplicity, and size. In one area,
we have the fetishization of small: sites like [microjs](http://microjs.com/)
exhibiting sub-1k projects, my own fascination with building the
[smallest presentation system possible](https://github.com/tmcw/pig), and
a long history of stuff like the [demoscene](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene),
with famed [64kb tricks](http://and.intercon.ru/?id=about).

There's a renewed interest in other forms of complexity, like
[cyclomatic complexity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity), which
is now measurable in Javascript with jsmeter and
[jscheckstyle](https://github.com/nomiddlename/jscheckstyle).

There are portals to other worlds of complexity, too:
every [regex](http://www.regular-expressions.info/)
is its own micro-software, with its own performance characteristics, bugs, and even
[security issues](http://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp3.html).

[simple-statistics](https://github.com/tmcw/simple-statistics) has made me more
aware of this than any other project: it's the only project for which I've produced
[literate documentation](http://macwright.org/simple-statistics/docs/simple_statistics.html),
and explaining every line reveals how much is implied and how much knowledge
can be contained in things we write every day.

It brings to mind something `_why` said 20 minutes into his
[ART && CODE talk](https://vimeo.com/5047563): that getting new programmers
to start with the web means making them learn three languages at the same time,
and three languages mixed together: HTML, Javascript, and CSS. Precisely how
the three affect one another is barely understood even by professionals.

I'm more and more aware of this when writing [example code](http://mapbox.com/mapbox.js/examples/) -
idioms that i've picked up, like using [ternary operations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_operation)
and [javascipt closures](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/111102/how-do-javascript-closures-work)
make code more concise, but with an attendant increase in skill required. It's like
[Simple English Wikipedia](http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page): where
is the line between 'simple javascript' and 'tricky javascript'?

If nothing else, programmers need to be brutally aware of their own
assumptions and assumed knowledge.
