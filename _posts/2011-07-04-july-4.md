[July 4th](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tmcw/sets/72157627119234444/with/5903274863/). My second Fourth in DC, and my Columbia Heights neighbors delivered again: community fireworks and simple cheeriness make me love this city. Last fourth doesn't seem very far away, but since then there have been many arrivals and departures from my house - including my own.
