[Minute](http://macwright.org/minute/) counts keystrokes and every
two minutes records how many keystrokes
have transpired in a [CSV file](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values).

[Minute-reader](http://github.com/tmcw/minute) uses [d3](http://mbostock.github.com/d3/)
to build a visualization in the style of [gel electrophoresis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel_electrophoresis).
It loads minute's data directly using d3's
CSV reader - the data is compact, so months of data should still be usable.

It's a subset of functionality that I found to
be really compelling in [workrave](http://www.workrave.org/)
and [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/) - it doesn't do anything
with the internet, like RescueTime, or tell you to change your ways
like WorkRave and other RSI-related applications.

It's easier for me to track my usage of technology
accurately than it is to track non-usage, so I'll treat leisure and sleep
time as the inverse and make no attempt to do some kind of [Arduino](http://arduino.cc)
hack to track hours of sleep.

The code is open-source and adaptable, but the Objective-C is shoddy
and would love improvement. For what it's worth, [Apple](http://www.apple.com/)
makes keylogger-writing easy with a very direct API:

{% highlight objc %}
[NSEvent
     addGlobalMonitorForEventsMatchingMask:NSKeyDownMask
     handler:^ (NSEvent *event) {
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight sh %}
~â‡¾ tail ~/log/keystrokes.log
1323966900, 206
1323967020, 76
1323967140, 27
{% endhighlight %}

Minute doesn't log which keys - only their frequency. An evil version,
'thisisakeylogger', does track keys but isn't open source. It's what I used to
generate graphs of key transitions.

<img width='640' height='200' src='/graphics/minute_sleep.png' title='hours of sleep per night' />

Incidence statistics make my [vim](http://www.vim.org/) usage apparent: jj, kk, ww, and bb
are all 'gestures' in the editor.

The above charts (besides minute's own output) are generated using
really simple bits of code with [node-canvas](https://github.com/LearnBoost/node-canvas)
as my preferred drawing toolkit. It's simple and near-perfect -
the Canvas specification doesn't jive with bitmap fonts, so I might
need to write some custom code to make [Silkscreen](http://kottke.org/plus/type/silkscreen/) usable.

I've been really interested in the style of my friend
[Zeolite Fuhrman](http://www.zeolitefuhrman.com/category/visualization/)
and the various projects going around based on
[libcinder](http://libcinder.org/). The other big design style is
[d3's](http://mbostock.github.com/d3) - white background, Helvetica'ed,
[ColorBrewer'ed](http://colorbrewer2.org/) information. Somewhere between the two
seems about right - there's a certain beauty to infographics that are made
to be puzzling for a few seconds before the understanding strikes.

Tracking nearly anything you do is alarming
and humbling. The aggregates of our actions are lost on us: we can
watch hundreds of hours of television and write it off as a small time commitment.
How much is too much? It's hard to make pretty charts without learning something
and thinking about what they _should_ look like.
