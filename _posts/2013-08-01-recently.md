This month I worked a bit on [geojson.io](http://macwright.org/2013/07/26/geojsonio.html),
a tool for drawing, changing, and sharing GeoJSON map data.

Along with that
came [geojsonhint](https://github.com/tmcw/geojsonhint), a [JSON](http://www.json.org/)
and [GeoJSON](http://www.geojson.org/) validator that works in browsers
and in node.js and on your command-line. The wheelie is that it provides
line numbers, thanks to a jury-rigged [jsonlint fork](http://github.com/tmcw/jsonlint)
that adds `__line__` members to objects and arrays it parses.

At MapBox I mostly worked on internal tools, splitting out open-source
modules ([superenv](https://github.com/mapbox/superenv), [generate-geo-testing-data](https://github.com/mapbox/generate-geo-testing-data),
[basic-queue](https://github.com/mapbox/basic-queue), [log-reader](https://github.com/mapbox/log-reader))
where possible. Those internal tools to be specific are `mapbox-cli`, the
nodejs CLI tool we use to deploy and update services like frontend, tilestream-pro,
unpacker, and CouchDB boxes, and [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/)-based
testing for those applications. The eventual goal is something like
[etsy's level of deployment nirvana](http://etsy.me/deployinator) to enable
more of the MapBox team to see the core product as changeable.

Up in NYC, I [presented on d3 to the GothamJS conference](http://macwright.org/presentations/gotham-2/#0).
It went pretty well; the talk was mostly about using d3 in [iD](http://ideditor.com/)
and how it's not just for visualization.

[Teen Mom](http://teenmomdc.com/) played a show at the Far Out House in Silver
Spring, MD, and has four new tracks mixed & mastered, ready for us to decide
how to distribute - likely as singles.

Friends held a 'solidly summer meal' that was delicious and perfectly
coincided with one of the most beautiful days of summer, sunset and all.

Stephen launched [yankeepope.com](http://yankeepope.com/) and posted many great things there.

### Reading

* [Jesse Kriss's 'Move Fast and Donâ€™t Break Things'](https://medium.com/p/6e4a02e52078) is
  intelligent and beatifully concise.

### Listening

I was late to quite a few album releases, but am slowly catching up:

* [Mac Demarco 2](http://bit.ly/13pDrDe)
* [Alt-j - An Awesome Wave](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Awesome_Wave)
* Chestnut Collection posted [Filled In: Short Songs](http://chestnutcollection.bandcamp.com/),
  which are great, especially [You'd Never See the Day](http://chestnutcollection.bandcamp.com/track/youd-never-see-the-day).
