This month I worked a bit on [geojson.io](http://macwright.org/2013/07/26/geojsonio.html),
a tool for drawing, changing, and sharing GeoJSON map data.

Along came [geojsonhint](https://github.com/tmcw/geojsonhint), a [JSON](http://www.json.org/)
and [GeoJSON](http://www.geojson.org/) validator that works in browsers,
node.js and your command-line. The wheelie is that it coughs out
line numbers, thanks to a jury-rigged [jsonlint fork](http://github.com/tmcw/jsonlint)
that adds `__line__` members to objects and arrays it parses.

At MapBox I improved internal tools, splitting out open-source
modules ([superenv](https://github.com/mapbox/superenv), [generate-geo-testing-data](https://github.com/mapbox/generate-geo-testing-data),
[basic-queue](https://github.com/mapbox/basic-queue), [log-reader](https://github.com/mapbox/log-reader)),
improving our deploy binary, and adding continuous integration testing
to core code. The eventual goal is something like
[etsy's level of deployment nirvana](http://etsy.me/deployinator) to enable
more of the MapBox team to see the core product as changeable.

We're also working a bit on managing scale, with [33 people on the team](http://www.mapbox.com/about/team/)
and [121 public repos on GitHub](https://github.com/mapbox). This is one tool for that
- a [Sankey diagram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankey_diagram) that pulls recent
activity for everyone on all projects and shows what people are working on.
I mulled over the representation for a while, thinking that a [co-occurrence matrix](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/miserables/)
or just 'groups of names' might work, but the Sankey seems like a good compromise.
Especially when you can represent a value like 'amount' spatially rather than
with color, it's an instant-understanding win.

Up in New York City, I [presented on d3 to the GothamJS conference](http://macwright.org/presentations/gotham-2/#0).
It went pretty well; the talk was mostly about using [d3](http://d3js.org/) in [iD](http://ideditor.com/)
and how it's not just for visualization - basically ['d3 for HTML'](http://macwright.org/2013/07/07/d3-for-html.html)
with voicecracks.

[Teen Mom](http://teenmomdc.com/) played a show at the Far Out House in Silver
Spring, MD, then [released a song](https://soundcloud.com/teenmomdc/kitchen)
and [our Daytrotter session went live](http://www.daytrotter.com/#!/concert/teen-mom/20056442-37383614).

Friends held a 'solidly summer meal' that was delicious and perfectly
coincided with one of the most beautiful days of summer, sunset and all.

### Reading

* [Jesse Kriss's 'Move Fast and Don’t Break Things'](https://medium.com/p/6e4a02e52078) is
  intelligent and beatifully concise.

### Listening

I was late to quite a few album releases, but am slowly catching up:

* [Mac Demarco 2](http://bit.ly/13pDrDe)
* [Alt-J - An Awesome Wave](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Awesome_Wave). The idea of Alt-J
  being a reference to a key combination you need to type to output their real name, ∆,
  is something.
* Chestnut Collection posted [Filled In: Short Songs](http://chestnutcollection.bandcamp.com/),
  which are great, especially [You'd Never See the Day](http://chestnutcollection.bandcamp.com/track/youd-never-see-the-day).
