I [made edit-geojson](http://macwright.org/edit-geojson/) a bit better and more
useful. As before, it's just a little special sauce on top of [Leaflet.draw](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.draw),
[Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/), and [CodeMirror](http://codemirror.net/), and
I'm pretty surprised that there aren't great alternatives.

Up in NYC, I [presented on d3 to the GothamJS conference](http://macwright.org/presentations/gotham-2/#0).
It went pretty well; the talk was mostly about using d3 in [iD](http://ideditor.com/)
and how it's not just for visualization.

My friend Stephen launched [yankeepope.com](http://yankeepope.com/) and has posted
many great things there.
