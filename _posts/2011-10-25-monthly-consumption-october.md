This is quite a month. First
[a trip to the Poconos with some old friends](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tmcw/sets/72157627741886967/),
and then a meeting to talk about the future of [Carto](https://github.com/mapbox/carto)
with [Stamen](http://stamen.com/) and [Google](http://google.com/)
in San Francisco and then Mountain View.

Then I have the treat of being a keynote speaker at
[WhereCamp Boston](http://www.wherecampboston.com/) alongside
[Jeff Warren](http://unterbahn.com/). It'll be the first time
I talk outside of a narrow, technical topic in quite a while.
(my presentations are [listed in about](http://macwright.org/about/))
So I'm hoping to have some fun with it - to refine
[big](https://github.com/tmcw/big), the hacky presentation software
I wrote for/at my presentation at [FOSS4G](http://foss4g.org), and to
talk about something a little crazier.

  in [Uncommon Places](http://www.seesawmagazine.com/shore_pages/shore_interview.html),
  a thoroughly fantastic book from [my sister](http://sarahmacwright.com/).
  I've been using some of the photos as references for
  [terribly amateurish watercolors](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tmcw/sets/72157627680586249/).

* And, of course, some obscure technology: the
  [world's best introduction to sed](http://www.catonmat.net/blog/worlds-best-introduction-to-sed/)
  by [Peteris Krumins](http://www.catonmat.net/) is eye-opening.
* And some obscure math: I had too much fun reading
  [An Adventure in the Nth Dimension](http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/id.13850,y.0,no.,content.true,page.1,css.print/issue.aspx),
  an article about n-dimensional spheres and cubes and their bizarre
  relationships of volume.
* On [Saman's recommendation](http://www.flickr.com/photos/samanpwbb), I read
  [Extra Lives](http://www.randomhouse.com/book/13989/extra-lives-by-tom-bissell/9780307378705)
  on video gaming and also happened to find
  [Destroy all Monsters](http://believermag.com/issues/200609/?read=article_lafarge) from Believer magazine.
  I haven't played a computer game in years and have never played D&D
  (despite [naming a library after it](https://github.com/tmcw/dnd)), but
  I'm starting to feel like I should: there's definitely something there.

## Next

In other news, [Teen Mom](http://twitter.com/teenmomdc) was selected to play
the [DCWeek](http://digitalcapitalweek.org/) opening party - so we're
playing the 9:30 club on November 4th!
[Get tickets](http://dcweek11opening-band7.eventbrite.com/)! It'll be
quite a time.

And, sneaking up on me, November is the month for
[hometaping 3](http://www.hmtpng.com/), so I'm going to be recording an
album, start to finish. Hopefully I'll be able to make it complete - crazy
to think that [last year's album](http://pueblo.bandcamp.com/album/histories)
is a year old now - but it's time!
