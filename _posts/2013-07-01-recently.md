I worked on the UI-side of [some incredible maps](http://www.mapbox.com/blog/visualizing-3-billion-tweets/) that MapBox made in collaboration
with [Eric Fischer](http://www.flickr.com/photos/walkingsf/).
They [were](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/06/20/twitter-map) [pretty](http://www.theatlanticcities.com/jobs-and-economy/2013/06/map-iphone-users-any-city-and-you-know-where-rich-live/5961/)

## Music

[Teen Mom](http://teenmomdc.com) played a show at [Comet Ping Pong](http://www.cometpingpong.com/)
which [DMVicious](http://dmvicious.com/2013/06/18/about-last-night-teen-mom-other-factors-go-cozy-at-comet-ping-pong/) and
[DC Rock Live](http://dcrocklive.blogspot.com/2013/06/teen-mom-other-factors-go-cozy-comet.html)
liked.

Then we played a show at [Broom Factory Factory](https://www.facebook.com/BroomFactoryFactory) in
Baltimore, with a few great bands, like [Brenda](http://brendadc.bandcamp.com/) and
[The Can't Tells](http://thecanttells.com/).

## Projects

I finally made a [website for simple-statistics](http://macwright.org/simple-statistics/)
on [Max Ogden](http://maxogden.com/)'s sage advice, and finally realized
how much of a problem it is to have a GitHub project as the only landing page
for something. While it's a familiar sight for core developers, to the uninitiated,
it's over-complex and overfilled with information that's unrelated to just understanding
and using a thing.

<a href='http://macwright.org/big/'><img src='http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2818/9184419630_6a4bc8e4cb_b.jpg' class='white-on-white' /></a>

Then I did the same for [Big](http://macwright.org/big) and have started
to think about how I should handle the maturity of a project that was and still
is sort of a postmodern joke.

I joined the [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) club and am currently
pretty darn impressed by it.

## Consumption

Big thanks to [Erin Kissane](http://incisive.nu/about/), [Charlie Lloyd](http://vruba.tumblr.com/)
and crew for spreading the word about a big sale at the [MIT Press](http://mitpress.mit.edu/),
where I got a stack of books. The best so far is [Fashioning Apollo](http://fashioningapollo.com/),
which intriguing and inspiring in so many directions.

Been listening to a lot of the [Can't Tells](https://vimeo.com/37158974) since
playing with them in Baltimore.

* [Interview with Don Knuth](https://www.simple-talk.com/opinion/opinion-pieces/don-knuth-and-the-art-of-computer-programming-the-interview/) in Simple Talk. I'm
  honestly not a big fan of Knuth, though probably only in the way that his language
  and ideas are unreachable to common folk like me.
* [Looking it in the Face](http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2013/jun/04/looking-it-face/) by
  the incredible Charles Simic. I wish newspapers were all things like this.

## Dashboards & Transit

One of my big tasks at [MapBox](http://www.mapbox.com/) the last week
has been making a series of 6 dashboards that run 24/7 on big displays. It's
one of those odd internal projects with a elliptical purpose but in the meantime:
glowing things.

Some of this code has found its way into [d3tron](http://github.com/tmcw/d3tron)
and [nextbus-widget](https://github.com/tmcw/nextbus-widget). The dashboards
hit a lot of APIs: [Tender](http://tenderapp.com/), [PagerDuty](http://www.pagerduty.com/),
[ServerDensity](http://www.serverdensity.com/), [WMATA](http://www.wmata.com/),
[DarkSky](http://darkskyapp.com/), [Gaug.es](http://gaug.es/), and a few internal
endpoints.

## WMATA API API

<span class='image-credit'><a href='http://flic.kr/p/58wAK8'>image by Elvert Barnes</a></span>

The most annoying of which has been [WMATA](http://www.wmata.com/) DC's transit
system, which gives bus and train predictions, amongst other information. Unfortunately,
the city uses [Mashery](http://www.mashery.com/) to 'manage' the API frontend,
which leads to an artificially low limit on API requests (alas, not
the [only example of DC making bad contractor decisions](http://macwright.org/2013/02/20/you-cannot-have-the-code.html)).

That said, I've gotten pretty good at jumping from problem to solution without
the annoyance stage. It's an odd technique, but [wmataapiapi](https://github.com/tmcw/wmataapiapi)
is an API on WMATA's API that [currently has an instance on Heroku](http://secret-wildwood-1777.herokuapp.com/)
that you can [build things on](http://bl.ocks.org/tmcw/raw/5897637/) that would
consume your API limit very quickly otherwise.

While [wmata-client](https://github.com/tmcw/wmata-client) which makes some computation
local and fast and will eventually hit `wmataapiapi` as soon as it supports more things.
This deserves a real post of its own when I have more code to demonstrate the abstract.
