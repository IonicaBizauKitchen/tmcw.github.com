**mapschool** is an educational project about maps. In modern-day terms, it's about GIS,
cartography, and a bit of everything else, but it focuses on concepts and
working knowledge, rather than taxonomy. It's for people who want to understand
how we draw earth in pictures at the most basic level. I hope that it's a
complementary piece to more technical literature that empowers people to
think critically about tools and techniques.

I started mapschool out of frustration with existing learning materials. The
field of GIS was somewhat cursed by its dual nature as product and discipline:
early companies in the field like Esri took it up on themselves to popularize
the idea of maps in computers and categorize tasks, jobs, and quibble
about names. In this process, there are perverse incentives to teach the field
as if it isn't possible without an ArcGIS license.

Thus, in an odd move for a programmer, I tried writing the core of mapschool
in a technology-agnostic manner, and it has mostly continued in that direction.

It's also an attempt to explore the space of 'textbooks' on the internet.
It floats somewhere between the style of a blog, of Wikipedia, and traditional
print. I'm trying to deemphasize hyperlinks and interactive demos
so that it can be printed in black & white and still make sense as a
self-contained piece.

There's still space to explore. Should there be 'in-depth' sections for
each paragraph? Would this make sense as an ebook or as a weekly email series?
How should translations be created and maintained?

At this point, it's a matter of collaboration - already some folks have contributed
vital fixes and improvements, and I hope that the next stages of refining
and illustrating the text will lead it in the right direction.

The highest priority is to get feedback from people for whom it is actually
an introductory text, to determine where there are gaps in the explanation or unanswered
questions. It's impossible for people with deep experience to read without
context and understanding: it's vitally important for onboarding testing to really
involve new people.

I'm very excited to see where this goes. Education needs to stop sucking, and
this is a first shot at doing that on a larger scale. If you've got something
