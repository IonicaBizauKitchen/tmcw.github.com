[mapmote](https://github.com/tmcw/mapmote) is a powertool for [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/)
editing with [JOSM](http://josm.openstreetmap.de/). It's a Chrome extension
(and now a bookmarklet!)
that lets you open a JOSM session from a variety of websites other than
OpenStreetMap itself.

The idea came from [AJ Ashton](http://ajashton.ca/), the chief cartographer
at [MapBox](http://mapbox.com/). Using maps, while we design interfaces,
debug code, and do cartography, often reveals flaws in the map data.
OpenStreetMap.org, of course, has a menu that shows editing options,
and the pros prefer JOSM, a powerful desktop editor.

_mapmote gives you the equivalent of that button on other maps._ That
includes any [Modest Maps](http://modestmaps.com/), [OpenLayers](http://openlayers.org/),
[Leaflet](http://leaflet.cloudmade.com/), or Google standard map that
use [XYZ tiles](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_map_tilenames).

<small>How it does this is kind of crazy. It sniffs for all image elements
in the page, optionally detecting the map client, and then sniffs for
tile coordinates like `1/2/2.png`, and then collects, projects, and
unions them into a bounding box. Once it has a bounding box, it, like
osm.org, inserts an iframe onto the page which hits a URL that JOSM
sets up for its 'remote control' functionality and passes the bounding
box to the editor.</small>

**Update** it's now also available as a simple bookmarklet! Just drag the link
below to your bookmarks bar and then click it when you're on a map-containing
webpage.

If you want mapmote as a Chrome Extension... well,
Google is being [silly](http://storify.com/tmcw/google-chrome-web-store)
about the Chrome Web Store, so it's not available there.
Instead, I've posted [mapmote.crx in the downloads of the repository](https://github.com/tmcw/mapmote/downloads)
and will reproduce the [hard-to-find directions here](http://support.google.com/chrome_webstore/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=2664769&p=crx_warning):

1. Download and save `mapmote.crx`
2. Click the wrench icon on the browser toolbar.
3. Select Tools > Extensions.
4. Locate the extension file on your computer and drag the file onto the Extensions page.
5. Click Install.
