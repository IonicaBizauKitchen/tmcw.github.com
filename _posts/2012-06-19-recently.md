I attended [IRE 2012](http://ire.org/conferences/ire-2012/) in Boston, which was
the farthest from a tech conference that I've gone so far. Boston's Back Bay neighborhood
is not beautiful and devoid of coffee shops with wifi. On the bright side, I saw a friend
who's busy opening [Georgetown Cupcake on Newbury](http://www.georgetowncupcake.com/),
and got to wander around a different city for a while.

[Teen Mom](http://teenmomdc.com/) got a mention in [The Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/13/scott-lucas-and-the-marri_n_1593324.html),
and played [Fort Reno](http://www.fortreno.com/) in June. It's good to have music
happening, though it's been a long time since I [wrote or posted original tunes](http://pueblo.bandcamp.com/).
Trimming down the gear - to just my '94 Telecaster, Princeton, Twin, and pedals.

* [10 Timeframes](http://contentsmagazine.com/articles/10-timeframes/) by [Paul Ford](http://www.ftrain.com/)
  is an exceptional example of thinking and writing.
* [pre3d.js](https://github.com/deanm/pre3d/blob/master/pre3d.js) by
  [Dean McNamee](http://www.deanmcnamee.com/) brought me one step closer to the
  aha moment of understanding 3D vector math.
* [Wikipedia's page on ZIP codes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_Codes) is
  at once exhaustive and engaging.
* [The Navy Electricity and Electronics Training Series](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:FjN_RVSAhHMJ:www.hnsa.org/doc/neets/mod17.pdf+&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESiutYQIVRV6lyuk3PKtnlvrX5leezvTvhkWi2la6lIMXe1hd3gMb_daWctr6sN3_NW0gmNGw9hEdgzzuuHELYKgkAbAD-1qR_qoHpxwFysXVZRqqV2eJF7hKPD5qd8BFIl4c0E-&sig=AHIEtbSttIaEyWaG3CdU0iN93rYYG-AWgw&pli=1)
  is the best thing to read on planes if you want to learn a bit of electrical engineering.

After writing a new feature for MapBox Hosting, I'm looking at spending some time
tightening up the many projects I now feel some sort of parent-instinct for, despite
having varied roles in their actual creation. So hopefully [Modest Maps](http://modestmaps.com/),
[Wax](http://www.mapbox.com/wax/), [MMG](http://mapbox.com/mmg), and [Carto](http://mapbox.com/carto)
will all see a bit of a boost.

Besides work-related projects, I'm working on a [simple statistics](https://github.com/tmcw/simple-statistics/)
module that'll soon be described in full, as well
as [turning keystrokes into sound](https://github.com/tmcw/keypainting),
[turning sound into images](https://github.com/tmcw/audlet),
and [turning images into sound](https://github.com/tmcw/playcanvas).
Audio is a fascinating thing, from the [web audio api](http://chromium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/samples/audio/index.html)
to just the basic crazy concepts like [nyquist-shannon sampling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem)
and [additive synthesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_synthesis). More on that soon.
