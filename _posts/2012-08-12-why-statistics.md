Because _hard algorithms are unsexy, difficult, and rewarding_. And few
people want to implement them, so the implementations that do exist get
spread and ported, and have a much longer half-life than your typical
jQuery plugin.

Because _visualization is bad at some tasks_. Most of all, it's bad at
_[saying no](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_hypothesis)_.
We're great at pattern recognition and correlation:
that's what makes the [geospatial sector](http://mapbox.com/) so hot. Everything
has latitude and longitude, so geodata is inherently compatible. But sometimes
there's nothing: most hard research ends up finding no cause, or too little
evidence to make a strong statement. How often does a pretty visualzation do
the same? If the goal is to [understand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis),
it should include understanding the void.

Because _statistics is poorly taught and poorly explained_. Math jargon is taken
as a matter of course, with only
[alternatives at the edges of thought](http://worrydream.com/KillMath/).
Computational statistics has grown its [own world](http://www.r-project.org/)
that makes it less accessible to other areas of computation.
People think the problem with this is that fewer _producers_ will use statistics
to do their analysis: but the real problem is that lack of statistical
literacy makes it harder for _consumers_ to understand what they're seeing.
We talk about [how to lie with statistics](http://ds.io/MrU2Vo)
but not how to detect lies, re-run calculations, or articulate problems in
analysis.
